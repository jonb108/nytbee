<h1><span class=green>NYT Bee Command Line</span><br>Apple Mac Installation</h1>
<p>
There is a <a target=_blank href='https://youtu.be/fgCGvd8KZXk'>YouTube video</a>
that shows the installation process below.
<p>
Click on this link: <a href=nytbee.pl>nytbee.pl</a> to download
the command line program to your Downloads folder.
<p>
The program is written in the
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.perl.com'>Perl</a> language.
Perl is <i>already</i> installed on Apple machines.
<p>
The program will run inside the <span class=green>Terminal</span> application and it needs the following configuration steps:
<ol>
<li>In the Finder click on Applications.
<li>In the Utilities folder find Terminal.  Drag and drop it to a convenient place in the Dock.
<li>Click on Terminal in the Dock to open it.
<li>Alternatively, you could create a Terminal icon on the Desktop and double click it to open it.
<li>From the top-level menu of Terminal choose <span class=green>Terminal > Preferences</span>.
<li>On the <span class=green>Text</span> tab choose <span class=green>Change</span>
to change the font size to 24.
<li>On the <span class=green>Shell</span> tab you will check the <span class=green>Run Command</span> check box and enter this in the text field:
<ul>
<pre style="font-size: 20pt">
perl ~/Downloads/nytbee.pl
</ul>
</pre>
The funny character <span style="font-size: 24pt">~</span> above is a tilde.
It is found at the upper left of your keyboard.
<li><span class=green>Run inside shell</span> should be checked.
<li> Close the Preferences dialog.
<li>Quit Terminal
</ol>
<p>
Now you are all set.
Each day you simply click on Terminal in the Dock (or the Desktop) and
you will be playing today's NYT Bee puzzle.
It looks like this:
<ul>
<pre style="font-size: 20pt">
12/14/21
Enter h for help.

   D   G
 I   H   N
   O   T

> 
</pre>
</ul>
When you finish and quit the NYT Bee program you can also quit Terminal.
