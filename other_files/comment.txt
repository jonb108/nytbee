        why does it always choose TERRORIFIC?
        a different one each day - how is it chosen?
    not curated - only from the dictionary.txt
    pretty good!
    it's like a bonus game
    no ranks

history?

Perl is superb at text manipulation so it well suited
    to the task of Spelling Bee.
It's just text.  No real need for fancy graphics.

the full css, js to implement the spelling bee is very large
even when minimized!

NYTBee.com (Chris McLeester) provides answers to all puzzles.
It's like an archive.
But you can't _play_ the many previous days puzzles.
The New York Times does not provide a Spelling Bee archive.
not at midnight or .. the index.html file does not point properly at midnight?
https://nytbee.com/Bee_20211128.html is there but not nytbee.com

Another site:
spellingbeeanswers.com - not at midnight
You can see the archive.  A nice display (with score on hover)
but you can't play it!  It has ads. :(
Lots of crap in the HTML.  For the ads?
no contact email

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/crosswords/spelling-bee-forum.html
hints for previous days
going back how far?
2021/09/20 is the first - interesting - it IS recent
    or perhaps they aren't saving the earlier ones?

and:
https://nytspellingbeeanswers.org - not at midnight
a word press site
fancy format - but big deal
bottom/top letters - no - they can be permuted
all words are in length order; no secondary sort
asking for comment - what purpose?
only back to Jan 18, 2021
again, can't play the puzzles
lame

https://www.shunn.net/bee/ - yes at midnight
I've seen his name before... where?
ads on the site :( VERY annoying
shows the grid 
but not the 2 letter counts
can't play the puzzle
it solves it for you...
his archive goes back to 5/29/2018
an entertaining faq
https://www.shunn.net/blog/2020/08/you_cant_spell_preventable_without_a_bee.html
again, you can't play puzzles from the archive !
yet another software engineer plays with the bee.
it's part of his general blog
feedback@shun.net
nyt says the bee goes back to May 9, 2018
print edition to 2014

https://nytimes-spellingbee.com - not at midnight
ads on the site :(
it looks like it is 'branded' with the NYT logo
Stole the javascript/css/html from nytimes.com? yes.
in iframe links to nytbee.com - with permission?
be12343to@gmail.com
the iframe embeds this:

https://games-online.io/game/bee
stolen javascript:
    https://games-online.io/game/bee/resouce/js/o_spelling-bee.js
somehow they get around the necessity of logging in
no archive

and another:

https://spellingbeetimes.com - yes at midnight
https://spellingbeetimes.com/2021/11/26/new-york-times-nyt-spelling-bee-answers-and-solution-for-november-26-2021/
lots of ads :(
they have definitions - from somewhere - but not one for BIKING on 11/26/21?
back to 2/4/2020
they even generate a youtube video!  lame

and:
https://freebee.fun
enhanced free version of the game
you can play it.  no ads.
github: https://github.com/freebee-game/console-client/releases/tag/freebee-1.8
    need to compile.   didn't just work :(

puzzles are a kind of mental masturbation
    a great time waster
    so is endless fiddling with software :)
    nerdy obsessive
    but at least with software you have something
    useful at the end.  useful to others, too...


At nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee the allowed words ARE within the html.
Is it all available to curl even when not logged in?
The gameData is, yes.  So Chris McLeester grabs it all each day and 
stores it - as do I now.
I grabbed his archive in case it goes away.
    - except for 4 dates that were missing.

the missing ones I grabbed from https://shunn.net/bee
in addition to ones from may 29, 2018 to july 28, 2018

What is his lexicon for his list of words that are not allowed?

Making software is another way to enjoy the puzzle.
Not everyone can do it.
But you make something that others can enjoy.

Tell Deb Amlen about Pangram Haiku and my latest software fun.
Tell her about Chris McLeester and nytbee.com
    and the other sites as well - if she didn't know...

With my program you can play without a subscription.
    (not okay?)

Those WITH subscriptions can use my program to play and practice
    as much as they like.   With days that
    are not today you don't have the pleasure of knowing that
    others are doing the same puzzle.
    There is no sense of community.  
    Instead of crossword type clues from the community
    you have dictionary definitions.
    It's also just fun to easily define any word.  

JQSX - none as center letter
as of 11/28/21 there are 1281 puzzles in the archive
first in archive is on 5/29/2018
Spelling Bee began on 5/9/2018

Do Windows machines come with perl installed?
    No.
    OSX does.
    I could make an executable for windows.
        Is curl available?

Donate a little to Chris McLeester.

See donate button on 8/16/2021.
but not on ?
<input type=image> yes in Chrome not in Safari?  why?

I include all rows and columns of the word table
even if the sum is 0.  Different than the NYT Bee.

Trying to find the first day it was offered
I went back in time 2019 or earlier - he uses a different
format - why?  It is static text that he generated with
a script that has evolved?
He didn't go back and make them all the same.

20180729 - first one
20180802 - flawed - no puzzle on 7/6/18
20180803 - flawed 
20180804 - new format

20190608:
This puzzle's 81 possible answers rank it in the 100th percentile of all puzzles.
The last time there were more answers than this was on never. 
The highest number of answers was 81 on June 8, 2019. 

    Not true - highest number of answers SO FAR

who really cares about the graphs? no one!
it requires the browser to load lots of code - bokeh, etc

what is all the crap in the HTML?
    for bokeh?

history of commands?
    nah

list words in the order they were found?
    how to store this in the file?
    forget it

redo in Python?
redo in Javascript?
redo in Ruby?
it's a text manipulation exercise

do I need a Puzzle object?
it might clarify some things even though
but we have only one instance at a time.
it would proliferate the occurence of -> and self->{}
