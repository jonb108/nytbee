TODO:
W>> - increasing score (length and pangram...)

status - like hive - preserved over sessions
         default is graphics
BT - a toggle preserved based on which game you're on
     like HT or TL

51, 52, DR5 - if no more 5+ letter words - say so

ST - on the nose?  not quite - a bit over
8/23/22 - Dimwit Dominion Domino Midtown Minim Minion Motion Motto Timid Tomtit

for bee art not swiped from the NYT:
https://www.dreamstime.com/illustration/queen-bee-black-white.html

first - check to see if new_words contains a command or not.
    should be easy - this is the most common case...
    the rest could even be a separate process - to 
    reduce the compilation time?
    how fast does Perl process 2,000 lines????
    and don't create the hint table and two letter list
    unless you need to!

Max Bingo - could a word be very long, not a pangram
    yet be the word of maximum score for that initial letter?

Dez?  his work, history, puzzledom
admin.pl
update help.html about title, description, publish,
ID ... explained in help
add a video about new commands since other videos were made
make Collapse the default and remove CO
allow clicking on letters even if not mobile
SC - mark other ranks aside from Great, Amazing, Genius, Queen Bee?

Create a site to report missing Lexicon words.
    My program can add to it automatically. :)
    Nah. nytbee.com has a start...

Clues - have a <select> dropdown to choose an alternate format.
    Less obtrusive.   And they can select-all and copy, yes?
Have a comment that they shouldn't skip the clues.

BINGO - if a bingo is possible and the person HAS found 7 words
    with the initial letter - give them some kind of credit

S/regex
    => regexp.pl

Have a way to leave a comment for the puzzle maker.
    Like a forum.
    Timestamped

STatus or REmaining - to toggle showing line graphs
    that start long and get shorter with each word entered
    one for #words
    one for score - with little marks for the different ranks
    there's a similar thing on the NYTimes app (or webpage)
        but it has the same lengths for each rank.
        Mine would be linear and include Queen Bee.

what about showing words not yet found
    but only their length and the position of the center letter?

Each clue is a haiku.

when creating a puzzle
    somehow mark words that do NOT have s, re, ing?

why is the response time of pangram haiku puzzles tapping faster?

does copy to clipboard work on phone?

when Queen Bee is reached - show the ratio #hints/#points
    to two decimal points
    and log it 
    and have a command to show the 
        progress - table/graph
    when QueenBee is reached what is the ratio
    when QB is reached store it in the database
        words found in order plus first hint, # hints
    then list all queen bees with stats with QB command
        by date, click on the date

A new section in the help.html
    Lists of Words and Puzzles
    with links
ALL words
    word, length, frequency of use, first used
        dynamic, see if it's fast enough
    otherwise several files asc, desc, with links to each in heading
ALL puzzles
    date with #words, #points, #4letters, #pangrams, bingo?
at first - make these dynamic and see how fast it is
    otherwise - make a bunch of files - nah

when using the W commands add a count at the end
    of the lines in gray - just like the normal display

Bingo is not set properly - c y, i, g y and copy/paste, then i

in /bee link /bee-def add definitions - for an active dynamic grid
    add to the Help

given a date (like today) which words were used for the FIRST time?
    'FT', 'FT 4/5/19'

make the nyt_puzzles.txt file downloadable
    in some order

add your email address on the screen?
    info@logicalpoetry.com??
    with 'questions?   feedback?' like Karen

add definitions to /bee?
in the Help - add link to /nytbee

creating empty community puzzle - with a refresh somehow?

improve admin.pl - a table id, location, prog, grid, which games

LE ooooooC     use the parameter as the scrambled LEtters
    for making a nice screenshot (FINDME Y => indemnify)
    C is center letter, oooooo are the 6 outer letters
    document it in super power user section

document mobile use, define

admin.pl - show location (even multiple at same location) 
    with prog/grid tallies

id sahadev108!

    enter "your" id on each device
        and after each time you clear the cookies
    can share identities
    or just switch identities for two people in same house
        on same machine
    it saves the previous settings entirely

save game status and history in the database
    at some interval?  or before clearing the game...

separate files for each day's log in an log/ directory
a cgi-bin command to extract statistics from the day's log
    count of different people using the full vs dynamic grid
    count of dynamic single words vs multiple words entered
    locations of unique people (remember them in a DBM file)
        https://freegeoip.app/csv/$ip
    total lines

in dynamic.pl if someone enters 5 single words 
    show them the full application url
        in a pop up window they have to dismiss
    and remember you have done that so you don't spam them...

after making a new puzzle show the link to it

ask John Napiorkowski about FAST CGI or Dancer
    or Plack or PSGI or ... mod_perl
    if needed...

it is so fast - FastCGI or mod_perl or ...
    it's tricky with limited ability to install this or that
    dancer?

test suite!

tips, tricks

Art is about "drawing the line".
    we're getting very close to the end.
    so perhaps put your new ideas in a
    section called "Future Plans?"
    when are we done?  when adding anything else
    spoils what is already there.
    or when explaining the new thing is simply
    too complicated and would put off people
    from trying it in the first place!

find beta testers - friends and the hivemind
should it be labeled NYT Bee, ToBee, or what?

<script>
several functions that
may not be used - make them conditional
</script>

make more additions to js/

divide styles into two - static and dynamic
    static can be cached the browser
    cgi_style.css is a start
scripts, too

for a competition - announce a certain puzzle as the one for the day.
    this would work *only* with CP puzzles as all of the NYT puzzle
    answer words are available in various places - nytbee.com, shunn.net, etc
        add the page source!
    the competition puzzle has certain hint restrictions in place
        and these are announced.   as well as prizes :)
        and time limits - when is the last time?
    cheater programs?  yeah... :(  lexicon plus search, analysis
        participants would have to promise to not use them.
    command HR - what hint restrictions are in force for this puzzle?
    You enter the competition with a certain command
        then you give your name, the puzzle name.
    perhaps like 'ENTER CP5'
        you are prompted for mixed case Name, Location, and Contact Email
        and you are asked to promise to not use any other resource
    The time is noted along with your uuid.
    When you achieve Queen Bee for the puzzle the timer is stopped
        and the time is noted.
    For competition, the hint restrictions are enforced regardless
        of what NOH/OKH the person has in place...
        It's on a per *puzzle* basis from person to person, browser to browser.
    Results are tallied.  and made available somehow
    prizes?
    A nice dream, anyway :).

    for testing of clues - make puzzles (with accompanying clues)
        with TION pangrams (adoption, antagonizing, annihilation)
        (also add clues for NYT puzzles that have
        those words as pangrams and either N or O as center letter
        - like conduction on 8/26/21)
        and give these various clues for NOON:
        - the opposite of midnight
        - a palindromic time of day
        - John Wayne movie - High ____
        and these clues for TOOT:
        - honk
        - a palindromic sound
        - snort of a drug

some way to preserve your accomplishments?
print it

add to hint total when looking at all clues?
    clues are not as easy as dictionary definitions
    it's all just fun, anyway ...

at some point it becomes Art
practical use yields to beauty
to others its over-the-top impracticality
    seems insane and a waste of time
    but to the artist
    it gives meaning to life and is therapeutic
