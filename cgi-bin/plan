after get_nytbee.pl runs and
adds an entry into %puzzles (puzzles.dbm)
we run another program which reads all
the entries in puzzles.dbm and generates
all the other files we need.

it uses two other static files:
- the big lexicon from OSX
- the 10,000 common words from englishhere.com

this generation will be quick and it is not
necessary to try to optimize it.  if we did we'd
have to save (and versionize) the intermediate files
and that is trouble.

we _will_ generate a .txt version of puzzles.dbm
as a backup (chmod -r) and maybe for easier searching? and for
periodic submission to git for safekeeping.
