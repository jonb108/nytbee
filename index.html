<span class=c3>on the <span class=cl>Command Line</span></span>
</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The New York Times has had the Spelling Bee
puzzle in the print version of the weekly New York Times Magazine since 2014.
The daily <a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>
web version</a> launched on May 9, 2018.
Wikipedia has links to several <a target=nytbee href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Spelling_Bee'>stories about the game</a>
and the vibrant community of people who enjoy it.
Many people play the game on their phone with the New York Times app.
<p>
Now there's another way to play - on the <span class=cl><i>command line</i></span>.
<p>
Here is a <a target=nytbee href='https://youtu.be/PsWUQJXFb1s'>short film</a> that shows how it works.
There are several <a href=#advantages>advantages</a> to playing on the command line.   
Give it a try and <a href='mailto:Jon Bjornstad <jon.bjornstad@gmail.com>?subject=NYT Bee on the Command Line'>let me know</a> what you think.
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<img style="margin-left: 17mm; width: 280px" src=hive.png>
<ul>
<li>Create words using letters from the "hive".
<li>Words must contain at least 4 letters.
<li>Words must include the center letter.
<li>Letters can be used more than once.
<p>
<li>The list of allowed words does not include words
that are obscure, hyphenated, or proper nouns.
<li>No cussing either, sorry.
<p>
<li>Score points to increase your rating.
<li>4-letter words are worth 1 point each.
<li>Longer words earn 1 point per letter.
<li>Each puzzle includes at least one "pangram" which uses every letter. These are worth 7 extra points!
</ul>
<p>
If you haven't tried it before
<a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>try it now</a> on the web at <a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>nytimes.com</a>.
<a name=advantages></a>
<h2>Advantages of the Command Line</h2>
<ul>
<li>The table of hints is <u>dynamic</u> &ndash; it updates as you find words.
It's also easier to access the table.
<li>You can get dictionary definitions of puzzle words
without revealing them.
This is a fun way to challenge and enlarge your vocabulary.
<li>Letters in the words can be slowly revealed giving
another way to get hints.
<li>You can play puzzles from the large NY Times <a href=#archive>archive</a>.
You can play forever (and do nothing else &#128522;).
<li>You can play many puzzles and switch between them.
<li>You are shown how many points you need to get to the next level.
<li>You can clear a puzzle and play it again for practice.
<li>You can play when offline - Airplane mode.
<li>You can solve the full puzzle without a subscription to the Times.
<li>There is a Pangram Mode where you only look for pangrams.
<li>It is driven completely from the keyboard so is fast.
</ul>
<h2>Download and Install and Start</h2>
There are a few steps to get the program installed.
After this is done, it is very easy to start the program each day.
The process is different for Apple and Windows machines and
it is explained on these two pages:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee href='apple.html'>Apple Mac OSX</a>
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='windows.html'>Microsoft Windows</a>
</ul>
<p>
Do you have privacy, security, or safety concerns?
See <a target=nytbee href=privacy.html>this page.</a>
<h2>Commands</h2>
In addition to entering words that you have found
there are also many single letter commands.  Some commands
have parameters.
<p>
<pre>
<span class=cmd>h</span>  Show this Help
<span class=cmd>H</span>  How to play
<span class=cmd>p</span>  Permute the 6 non-center letters
<span class=cmd>w</span>  Words found in alphabetical order
<span class=cmd>W</span>  Words found in the order they were found

<span class=cmd>q</span>  Quit - the words found will be remembered
</pre>

<h4>Assist commands</h4>
<pre style="margin-top: 2px">
<span class=cmd>t</span>       Hints table and two letter hints
<span class=cmd>t1</span>      Hints table
<span class=cmd>t2</span>      Two letter hints
<span class=cmd>1</span>       Random entry from the hints table
<span class=cmd>2</span>       Random two letter hint

<span class=cmd>d x6</span>    Define words of length 6 beginning with x
<span class=cmd>d p</span>     Define pangrams

There may not be definitions for every word.
Definitions are from Merriam-Webster, Collins or Oxford.
Definitions are not available when playing offline.

With <span class=cmd>d</span> and <span class=cmd>v</span> words already found are skipped.
Spaces in <span class=cmd>d</span> and <span class=cmd>v</span> commands are optional <span class=cmd>v4x9</span> = <span class=cmd>v 4 x9</span>
The command <span class=cmd>e</span> is like <span class=cmd>v</span> but you'll see letters
at the beginning and End of the word.
</pre>

<h4>Other commands</h4>
<pre style="margin-top: 2px">
<span class=cmd>A</span>     Download the <a href=#archive>Archive</a> for offline play.
<span class=cmd>n &lt;date&gt;</span>   New puzzle from the given date - 10/20 or 2/5/19
<span class=cmd>lg</span>    Show the <a href=#log>timestamped log</a> 25 lines at a time.
      Return goes to next page, q quits.
<span class=cmd>lga</span>    Show the log with assists.
<span class=cmd>w &lt;prefix&gt;</span> Show found words starting with a prefix.
<span class=cmd>k</span>     Toggle clearing the screen or not.
      Useful to Keep text so you can scroll back.
<span class=cmd>d &lt;word&gt;</span>   Define the word - no assist tallied.
<span class=cmd>D ...</span> Like d but show all definitions instead of just 3.
      D also shows which dictionaries were used.
<span class=cmd>c</span>     After confirmation Clear the puzzle and start afresh.
<span class=cmd>C</span>     After confirmation Clear all saved puzzles.
<span class=cmd>g</span>     After confirmation Give up and show all words.

<span class=cmd>L</span>     List current puzzles with the 7 letters and center.
<span class=cmd>!...</span>  Execute a system command - like 'date'.
</pre>

<h2>Assist Strategy</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = Queen Bee <i>all by myself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
In this command line version there are many ways to get hints but
with each hint your 'assist total' is increased.
The number of assists are tallied like so:
<ul>
<pre>
<span class=black>Command   # of assists</span>
<span class=cmd>t</span>        15 but just once
<span class=cmd>t1</span>       10 but just once
<span class=cmd>t2</span>        5 but just once
<span class=cmd>d,D,v,e</span>   1 for each word
<span class=cmd>1</span>         1
<span class=cmd>2</span>         1
<span class=cmd>g</span>       100
</pre>
</ul>
<a name=pangram_mode></a>
<h2>Pangram Mode</h2>
The command <span class=cmd>P</span> puts you into "pangram mode" where you search
<i>only</i> for pangrams.  There are different commands in this mode:
<ul>
<pre>
<span class=cmd>h</span>    Show this help
<span class=cmd>p</span>    Permute the 7 letters
<span class=cmd>d</span>    Define the pangram(s)
<span class=cmd>v</span>    Reveal another letter
<span class=cmd>e</span>    Reveal another beginning and Ending letter
<span class=cmd>g</span>    Give up and show the pangram(s)
<span class=cmd>q</span>    Quit and return to Spelling Bee mode
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
The pangrams are chosen at random from a list of more than 1700 words
that have exactly 7 unique letters in them.
The list was derived from pangrams occuring in the NYT Bee puzzles
plus a large lexicon of commonly used words in which the letter S is allowed.
<p>
Note: There may be multiple pangrams for a given set of 7 letters.
However, not all valid pangrams are necessarily included.  For example,
ACELORT has electoral but not correllate or reallocate.
<h2>Other NYT Bee Projects</h2>
The NY Times Spelling Bee concept has been a fertile source of challenge for
many clever software engineers.
<p>
<h4>Games You Can Play</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='https://freebee.fun'>freebee.fun</a>
is a free web version of the game that you can play!
It doesn't use NYT words so the word list is not 'curated'.
There is no hint table.
Source code in C is available for a command line version.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/philshem/open-spelling-bee'>Philip Shemella</a>
A command line game you can play written in Python.
Again, doesn't use NYT words.  It also generates new games.

<h4>NY Times Puzzle Answers</h4>
The 7 sites below show the list of allowed words in the
NY Times puzzle for each day.  In a variety of formats.
The intention is to help people solve the puzzle or, more accurately,
see what words they missed.  Most have annoying ads. &#128542;

<h4>Code <i>Stolen</i> from the NY Times &#128127; &#128561;</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes-spellingbee.com'>nytimes-spellingbee.com</a> You can play it.  The interface is nearly <i>identical</i> to the NY Times - but no hint table.
It is even "branded" with the NYT logo.  What?
Yikes!  They <b>stole</b> the Javascript/CSS/HTML from nytimes.com and embedded
it in an iframe.  How did they get around the need to subscribe?
Clever, but evil somehow.
<h4>NY Times Engineering Director</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='nyt_engineering_director.pdf'>This page</a> is a December 9, 2021 advertisement for a job at the NY Times as Director of Engineering for the Games team - to manage 30 engineers!
<h2>Without a Subscription?</h2>
I <b>do</b> have a subscription to the Times.  It is a reliable,
trusted, and curated source of information.
Subscriptions help the many journalists stay focused on their story.
<p>
Is it illegal or unethical to play the NYT Spelling Bee without a subscription?
When the puzzle page is loaded into the web browser
the list of allowed words
<i>is</i> visible &ndash; if you know where to look.
This is what you will see in the page source:
<pre>
window.gameData = {
    "today": {
    "expiration": 1638345600,
    "displayWeekday": "Tuesday",
    "displayDate": "November 30, 2021",
    "printDate": "2021-11-30",
    "centerLetter": "h",
    "outerLetters": ["d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "validLetters": ["h", "d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "pangrams": ["goodnight", "hotdogging"],
    "answers": ["goodnight", "hotdogging", "dhoti", "doth",
        "godhood", "goth", "hiding", "high", "hind",
        "hinging", "hint", "hinting", "hitting", "hogging",
        "honing", "hood", "hooding", "hoodoo", "hoot",
        "hooting", "hotdog", "nigh", "night", "ninth",
        "nothing", "thigh", "thin", "thing", "thinning",
        "thong", "tight", "tithing", "tonight", "tooth"],
...
</pre>
So the words in the puzzle <i>are</i> available publicly each day.
The command line mechanism is simply a alternate way
of using these words.
<style>

<a name=same_7_letters></a>
<h2>Same 7 Letters</h2>
In the large NYT Spelling Bee archive there are many puzzles that share the
same set of 7 letters and hence the same pangrams.   
For example, here are 3 that
have occurred on 5 different dates:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5 border=0>
<tr><td class='green bold'>ADFLMPU</td><td>06/26/18</td><td>10/28/19</td><td>03/07/20</td><td>06/06/20</td><td>07/02/20</td></tr>
<tr><td class='green bold'>BILMOTY</td><td>07/20/18</td><td>10/27/19</td><td>06/04/20</td><td>12/01/20</td><td>07/09/21</td></tr>
<tr><td class='green bold'>GNORTUW</td><td>08/17/18</td><td>05/02/19</td><td>12/16/19</td><td>03/20/20</td><td>02/04/21</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<table cellpadding=5 border=1>
<tr>
<th># 7 letter sets</th>
<th># of dates</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>97</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>184</td><td>2</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
<p>
The <span class=cmd>f</span> command finds other dates that use the
same 7 letters as in the current puzzle.
These other puzzles usually (but not always)
have a different center letter.
<a name=log></a>
<h2>The Timestamped Log</h2>
The <span class=cmd>lg</span> command shows a timestamped log of
your activities in the puzzle.  As you reach each new level it shows
the total elapsed time in seconds and how many assists you had.
It records when you pause and resume the puzzle.  For example:
<ul>
<pre>
10:26 start
math
mirth
*Good Start* 0:33 with 0 assists
trim
*Moving Up* 0:35 with 0 assists
charm
*Good* 0:37 with 0 assists
mama
mamma
mart
*Solid* 0:47 with 0 assists
cram
tram
mitt
10:28 pause
11:05 resume
march
mimic
mahimahi
*Nice* 1:05 with 13 assists
mahatma
mariachi
matriarch*
*Amazing* 2:49 with 21 assists
...
</pre>
</ul>
The lines are shown 25 at at time.  At the ... prompt
you can hit Return to go on to the next page or type q to quit.
Each puzzle has its own log.
<a name=archive></a>
<h2>Archive</h2>
The archive was gathered mostly from
<a href=https://nytbee.com>nytbee.com</a>
and is added to daily at 3:00 a.m. EST by extracting the words
from the New York Times site.  There are daily puzzles going all the way
back to May 29, 2018.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>A</span> command downloads the entire archive so you can
play while offline.  You need to refresh it periodically.
<p>
Which puzzles from the large archive to play?
You can get one at random with the <span class=cmd>n</span> command or you could
choose one with various attributes like ones with the most points or the
fewest 4 letter words.
Start the puzzle with the <span class=cmd>n</span> command like so: 'n 4/6/19'
or by putting the date as a parameter on the command line when you first start nytbee.pl.
