<h2>Words and Commands</h2>
<p>
In the text field you enter words that satisfy the rules of the puzzle.
You can enter more than one word at a time.
<p>
Pressing Return will clear any messages and permute the 6 outer letters.
<p>
There are also several commands you can enter in the text field:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>R</span></td><td>Show the rankings.  It also shows how many points are needed to get to the next rank.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>W</span></td><td>Show the found words in the order they were found.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>C&nbsp;Y</span></td><td>Clear the puzzle and start over.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>G&nbsp;Y</span></td><td>Give up and show the word list.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<br>
Commands that give hints:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>HT</span></td><td>Show the Hint Table.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TL</span></td><td>Show the Two Letter List.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DP</span></td><td>Define the Pangrams.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DB4</span></td><td>Define the words beginning with B of length 4.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DTR</span></td><td>Define the words beginning with TR.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2><span class=cmd>D&nbsp;&lt;word&gt;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Define the word.  No hints tallied.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DA ...</span></td><td>The <span class=cmd>D</span> command gives at most 3 definitions. <span class=cmd>DA</span> will give them All.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V2P</span></td><td>Reveal the first two letters of the pangrams.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V3M8</span></td><td>Reveal the first 3 letters of the words beginning with M of length 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V5GL</span></td><td>Reveal the first 5 letters of the words beginning with GL.  
<tr><td colspan=2>Using <span class=cmd>E</span> instead of <span class=cmd>V</span> reveals letters at the front and at the <i>End</i> of the word.  Commands that reveal the entire word are silently ignored.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>Both define and reveal commands skip words that have already been found.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>1</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Hint Table.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>2</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Two Letter List.
<tr><td colspan=2>These will work even if the Table and List are not shown.</td></tr>

Commands to access the large NY Times <a href=#archive>Archive</a> of Spelling Bee puzzles:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>NR</span></td><td>New puzzle from a Random date.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>N &lt;date&gt;</span></td><td>New puzzle from the given date.  You can enter dates in several ways: 10-20-19 or 9-23 (current year) or 15 (current month).  Dates must be on or after May 29, 2018.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class=cmd>F</span></td><td>Find other dates that use the same seven letters.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>S&nbsp;&lt;word&gt;</span></td><td>Find other dates where the word is used.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Hint Strategy</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints
as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = Queen Bee <i>all by myself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
There are many ways to get hints and
each increases your 'hint total'.
The number of hints are tallied like so:
<p>
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Command</th><th align=left colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;# hints</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>HT</span></td><td align=right>10</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TL</span></td><td align=right>5</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D,DA</span></td><td align=right>3</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V,E</span></td><td align=right>2</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>1</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>2</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>G Y</span></td><td align=right>100</td></tr>
</table>
