<h2>Words and Commands</h2>
<p>
In the text field you enter words that satisfy the rules of the puzzle.<br>
You can enter more than one word at a time.
<p>
Pressing Return will clear any messages and permute the 6 outer letters.
<p>
There are also several commands you can enter in the text field:

<pre>
<span class=cmd>R</span>    Show the rankings.  It also shows how many
     points are needed to get to the next rank.
<span class=cmd>W</span>    Show the found words in the order they were found.
<span class=cmd>NR</span>   New puzzle from a Random date.
<span class=cmd>N &lt;date&gt;</span>  New puzzle from the given date.
     You can enter dates in several ways:
     10-20-19 or 9-23 (current year) or 15 (current month).
     Dates must be on or after May 29, 2018.
<span class=cmd>NT</span>   Return to Today's puzzle.
</pre>

Commands that give hints:

<pre>
<span class=cmd>HT</span>   Show the Hint Table.
<span class=cmd>TL</span>   Show the Two Letter List.

<span class=cmd>DP</span>   Define the Pangrams.
<span class=cmd>DB4</span>  Define the words beginning with B of length 4.
<span class=cmd>DTR</span>  Define the words beginning with TR.
<span class=cmd>D &lt;word&gt;</span>  Define the word.  No hints tallied.

<span class=cmd>V2P</span>  Reveal the first two letters of the pangrams.
<span class=cmd>V3M8</span> Reveal the first 3 letters of the words
     beginning with M of length 8.
<span class=cmd>V5GL</span> Reveal the first 5 letters of the words
     beginning with GL.  

     Using <span class=cmd>E</span> instead of <span class=cmd>V</span> in the above commands reveals
     letters at the front and at the <i>End</i> of the word.
     Both define and reveal commands skip words that have
     already been found.  Commands that reveal the entire word
     are silently ignored as are commands like V2GL. 

<span class=cmd>1</span>  Show a random entry from the Hint Table.
<span class=cmd>2</span>  Show a random entry from the Two Letter List.

   These will work even if the Table and List are not shown. 
</pre>

Other commands:

<pre>
<span class=cmd>C Y</span>  Clear the puzzle and start over.
<span class=cmd>G Y</span>  Give up and show the word list.
<span class=cmd>F</span>    Find other dates that use the same seven letters.
<span class=cmd>S &lt;word&gt;</span>  Find other dates where the word is used.
<span class=cmd>DA ...</span> The <span class=cmd>D</span> command gives at most 3 definitions.
       <span class=cmd>DA</span> will give them All.
</pre>
<h2>Hint Strategy</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints
as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = Queen Bee <i>all by myself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
There are many ways to get hints and
each increases your 'hint total'.
The number of hints are tallied like so:
<ul>
<pre>
<span class=black>Command      # of hints</span>
<span class=cmd>HT</span>          10
<span class=cmd>TL</span>           5
<span class=cmd>D,DA</span>         3 for each word
<span class=cmd>V,E</span>          2 for each word
<span class=cmd>1</span>            1
<span class=cmd>2</span>            1
<span class=cmd>G Y</span>        100
</pre>
</ul>
