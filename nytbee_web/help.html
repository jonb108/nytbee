<h2>How to Play</h2>
<h2>Words and Commands</h2>
<p>
In the text field you enter words that satisfy the rules of the puzzle.<br>
You can enter more than one word at a time.
<p>
Pressing Return will clear any messages and permute the 6 outer letters.
<p>
There are also several commands you can enter in the text field:

<pre>
<span class=cmd>R</span>    Show the rankings.  It will show how many
     points are needed to get to the next rank.
<span class=cmd>W</span>    Show the found words in the order they were found.
<span class=cmd>NR</span>   New puzzle from a Random date.
<span class=cmd>N &lt;date&gt;</span>  New puzzle from the given date.
     You can enter dates in several ways.
     10/20/19 or 9/23 (current year) or 15 (current month)
     Dates must be on or after May 29, 2018.
</pre>

Commands that give hints:

<pre>
<span class=cmd>DP</span>   Define the Pangram(s).
<span class=cmd>DB4</span>  Define the words beginning with B of length 4.
<span class=cmd>DTR</span>  Define the words beginning with TR.
<span class=cmd>D &lt;word&gt;</span>  Define the word.  No hints tallied.

<span class=cmd>V2P</span>  Reveal the first two letters of the pangram(s).
<span class=cmd>V3M8</span> Reveal the first 3 letters of the word(s)
     beginning with M of length 8.
<span class=cmd>V5GL</span> Reveal the first 5 letters of the word(s)
     beginning with GL.  

     Using <span class=cmd>E</span> instead of <span class=cmd>V</span> in the above commands shows
     letters both at the front and at the End of the word.  

<span class=cmd>1</span>  Show a random entry from the Hint Table.
<span class=cmd>2</span>  Show a random entry from the Two Letter List.

   These will work even if the Table and List are not shown.

Other commands:

<pre>
<span class=cmd>C Y</span>  Clear the puzzle and start over.
<span class=cmd>G Y</span>  Give up and show the word list.
<span class=cmd>F</span>    Find other dates that use the same seven letters.
<span class=cmd>S &lt;word&gt;</span>  Find other dates where the word is used.
<span class=cmd>DA ...</span> The <span class=cmd>D</span> command gives at most 3 definitions.
       <span class=cmd>DA</span> will give them All.
</pre>
<h2>Hint Strategy</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints
as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = Queen Bee <i>all by myself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
There are many ways to get hints and
each time your 'hint total' is increased.
The number of hints are tallied like so:
<ul>
<pre>
<span class=black>Command        # of hints</span>
<span class=blue>Hints Table</span>    10
<span class=blue>Two Letters</span>     5
<span class=cmd>D,DA,V,E</span>        1 for each word
<span class=cmd>1</span>               1
<span class=cmd>2</span>               1
<span class=cmd>G Y</span>           100
</pre>
</ul>
