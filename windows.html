<h1><span class=green>NYT Bee Command Line</span><br>MS Windows Installation</h1>
<p>
There is a <a target=_blank href='https://youtu.be/6tMYZ4Iz1HE'>YouTube video</a>
that shows the installation process below.
<p>
Click on this link: <a href=nytbee.exe>nytbee.exe</a> to download
the command line program - to your Downloads folder.
<p>
Microsoft rightfully worries about people downloading and installing
unknown software.  The video above shows how you <i>can</i> affirm
that the nytbee.exe program is okay to install.
<p>
Move the nytbee.exe file from Downloads to the Desktop.
<p>
You can now simply double click the desktop
<span class=green>nytbee</span> icon to start the program
and you will be solving today's puzzle!
<p>
The screen will look like this:
<ul>
<pre style="font-size: 20pt">

Enter h for help.

   D   G
 I   H   N
   O   T

&gt; 
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Note that you can enlarge the font of the command window
with these menu choices: Properties > Font. 
A 32 point font seems perfect.
