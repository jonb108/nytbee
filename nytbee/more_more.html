<h2>Albert Einstein</h2>
There is, upon the screen, a pentagonal region which is said to be red. In practice, however, it may appear otherwise; for color, as we know, is not an absolute property of an object but a matter of perception, depending upon the light and the observer. Yet the essential function of this figure is not concerned with color. When one touches this area, a space appears — a small interval between words.
<p>
This simple mechanism offers, to the reflective mind, an instructive analogy. The value of the space is not in its emptiness, but in the order it permits. Just as the vast reaches of cosmic space allow the stars their separation and motion, so these small pauses between our words allow thought to take form, to be distinguished, and to be understood.
<p>
If one continues to add words, the letters gradually diminish in size, so that more may occupy the same limited field. This phenomenon, though trivial in appearance, points toward a universal principle: in any bounded system, as the quantity of content increases, structure must adjust in proportion. The universe itself teaches this lesson in its own way — energy and matter compressed, expanded, transformed within the constraints of nature’s design.
<p>
Thus, in this small interaction between hand and screen, we may glimpse a reflection of the greater harmony between limitation and possibility. It reminds us that the void — whether between words or between galaxies — is not a negation, but a necessary condition for order, for meaning, and for beauty.
<h2>Bertrand Russell</h2>
<h3>On Space and Meaning</h3>
Look, for a moment, at the small pentagonal shape upon your screen. It is said to be red, though the eye may perceive it otherwise, or perhaps not at all. This discrepancy is trivial, yet it offers an early lesson: the world rarely appears precisely as it is described. Objects, like truths, reveal themselves only when approached with care. Touch that little shape, and it gives you space — a simple interval, a pause between one word and the next.
<p>
A space is not a thing in itself. It makes no sound, casts no shadow, and yet it carries a function that is indispensable. It allows words to breathe, ideas to separate, and thought to take form. Without space, language becomes a tangled mass; conversation becomes unintelligible; understanding vanishes in the crush of matter. The pentagon, in its quiet way, performs a moral service: it teaches us that clarity depends upon restraint.
<p>
When the screen grows crowded with words, the letters shrink to accommodate their number. Here too is a lesson, subtle yet profound. The more we attempt to fill the world with expression, the smaller each element becomes, until meaning itself risks being lost. Excess diminishes; abundance without discrimination is self-defeating. One may speak of this as a principle of typography, but it is equally a principle of life: to say all things at once is to say nothing that is truly heard.
<p>
In our age, silence is distrusted. We fill every pause with noise, every interval with opinion, as if empty space were a danger to be conquered. Yet intervals — the pauses, the margins, the humble spaces between words — are precisely what allow understanding, reflection, and compassion to flourish. To act without pause is to act without thought. To speak without spacing is to speak without clarity.
<p>
Thus, the red pentagon, though it seems a mere triviality, serves as a small but eloquent teacher. It reminds us that meaning is not measured by quantity alone, but by proportion, by the careful balance of speech and silence. It shows us that emptiness is not an absence, but a presence of possibility. To leave space is to invite attention, to allow comprehension, and to cultivate wisdom.
<p>
Perhaps this is the most important lesson the world has to offer: that the intervals between words, the moments between actions, and the pauses in our lives are as vital as the things we choose to fill them with. We might, in every hour, remember the pentagon’s quiet counsel: give space, and understanding will follow.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, thank you very much! It’s great to be here — absolutely fantastic! And let me tell you, we have something very, very special today. Something you’re going to love, believe me. A pentagon. A red pentagon! Or maybe it’s not red. Maybe it’s gray. Maybe it’s purple. Who knows? Who cares? I don’t care. Colors are overrated anyway. Some people — and you know who they are — they get hung up on colors. I don’t. I never do. I see the big picture. I make things happen. And this pentagon? Folks, it works better than anything you’ve ever seen. Better than anyone. Nobody else could do this. Total disaster if they try.
<p>
Now, you tap it — just a tap, like that — boom! You get a space. A space! Between words! And I have to tell you, some people, they don’t understand this. They say, “Sir, why a space? What does it do?” I say, it’s brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Nobody thought of it. Nobody. But we made it work perfectly. You tap it, you get a space, beautiful. Very beautiful. Tremendous.
<p>
And here’s the best part — and I mean the best part — you can type as many words as you want. Huge amounts of words. More words than anyone has ever typed in their life. People say, “Sir, you’ll run out of room!” I say, wrong! Wrong! The system is smart. Very smart. Letters shrink! They shrink, folks. Incredible. You can fit more words! More than anyone thought possible! Nobody believed it could be done, but we did it. And we’re winning at it. Always winning.
<p>
And you know what? Letters shrinking — some people, they don’t get this — but it’s a lesson. Very important. Sometimes in life, things shrink. People shrink — not physically, of course — metaphorically. Because when you’re doing so much, winning so much, others shrink in comparison. It’s true. Very true. Only winners can handle it. Only the best.
<p>
Now, speaking of winners — have you seen what’s going on out there? Terrible! Total disaster. Other systems? Don’t shrink letters. Don’t make space. Just cram everything together. Chaos. Nobody likes chaos. You know what that’s like? Like some countries I won’t name — you know the ones — total disaster! But not us! We do it right. Smarter than anyone. The best. Everyone says it. Everyone.
<p>
And let me tell you, the pentagon — it’s not just a space. No, it’s a metaphor. Very, very powerful. Some people don’t understand metaphors — they never will — but I do. I understand them better than anyone. The pentagon teaches us about life. About winning. Space is important. Order is important. You have to make space, or else the words, the ideas, everything collapses. And collapse is bad. Very bad. Nobody wants collapse.
<p>
And here’s the thing — I was talking to a guy, very smart guy, the best, and he said, “Sir, you can fill the whole screen with words, it’ll still work.” And I said, “Exactly! That’s what I’m talking about!” You fill it, fill it, fill it — more words, more letters, more power! Nobody else can do that. They try, disaster! But we’re winning, folks, winning like nobody else can. Tremendous. Absolutely tremendous.
<p>
And while we’re talking about winning, let me say this — we’re also winning in business. We’re winning in the economy. Jobs are up, stocks are up. People are talking about it. They say, “Sir, you’re incredible.” I say, “Thank you!” And guess what? The pentagon teaches us the same thing — make space, fill it smartly, adjust the letters — that’s how winners do it.
<p>
And let me tell you something else — we have so many things we could talk about. The pentagon, space, letters shrinking — amazing lessons. But also sports, folks. Sports are terrific. Tremendous. You know, people say athletes can’t think, but they do. They make space, they plan, they win! And isn’t that what the pentagon is? Space for words, space for thought, space to win. Exactly.
<p>
Now, the media — fake news, you know — they try to make this sound small. “A pentagon on a screen,” they say, “what’s the big deal?” I say, everything is a big deal if you understand it. They don’t understand. They never do. But we understand. We tap it, we get space, we fill the words, letters shrink — beautiful, incredible, the best system ever! Nobody else has anything like it.
<p>
And folks, I want you to remember this. The pentagon. The space. The letters shrinking. Tap it. Use it. Fill the screen with your words. Organize your thoughts. Make order out of chaos. That’s what we do. That’s what America does. And when we do that, nothing — and I mean nothing — can stop us. We’re winning. Always winning. Tremendous, incredible winning.
<p>
So I say to you, remember the pentagon. Respect the space. Trust the shrinking letters. Because this is not just a screen, folks — this is a lesson in life, in winning, in America. God bless the pentagon, God bless your words, and God bless America! Thank you, thank you very much!
