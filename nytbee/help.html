<h2>Introduction</h2>
The New York Times has had the Spelling Bee
puzzle in the print version of the weekly New York Times Magazine since 2014.
The daily <a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>
web version</a> launched on May 9, 2018.
Wikipedia has links to several <a target=nytbee href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Spelling_Bee'>stories about the game</a>
and the vibrant community of people who enjoy it (the "HiveMind").
Many people play the game on their phone with the New York Times app.
<p>
Here is the NY Times version:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee1 href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee</a>
</ul>
Now there's <i>another</i> way to play:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee2 href='https://logicalpoetry.com/cgi-bin/nytbee.pl'>logicalpoetry.com/nytbee</a>
</ul>
This new enhanced alternate mechanism has several 
<a href=#advantages>advantages</a>.
One <i>dis</i>advantage is that it is not easy to play on a mobile phone.
It works best with an actual keyboard on a laptop or desktop computer.
<p>
There are several <a href=#videos>videos</a> to show how it works.
<p>
Give it a try and <script>abcd('let me know');</script> what you think.

My name is Jon Bjornstad.  I live in Davis, CA.  I am 72 years old.
I retired from the corporate software world a few years ago
but I still very much enjoy the art of programming.
In short, I am an old Perl hacker.
When I saw the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a> of the NYT Spelling Bee
and realized that it was <i>static</i>, that it did not change as
you found words, I immediately thought, "That's not right.  I can do better."
And I have.  The complete source code for this project is on

<h2>Words and Commands
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The new mechanism looks like this:
<p>
<img width=500 src=pics/new_look.png>
<p>
In the text field you enter words that satisfy the rules of the puzzle.
You can enter more than one word.  Press Return to check that the words are
acceptable.  Any error messages will appear above the text field.
<p>
Pressing Return when the text field is empty will clear any messages.
If there are no messages to clear the 6 outer letters will be permuted.
<p>
If you lose focus on the text field you can restore it by
hitting the Tab key.
<p>
There are also many commands you can enter in the text field:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>H</span></td><td>Cycle through different presentations
of the 7 letters  - Honeycomb to Flower to Inline Letters to Hex Letters.<p>
<img height=150 src=pics/df_honeycomb.png><img height=150 src=pics/df_flower.png>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img height=70 src=pics/df_inline.png><img height=130 src=pics/df_hexlet.png>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>I</span></td><td>Show <span class=cmd>I</span>nformation about the puzzle including numbers of words, points, and pangrams.
<p>If the puzzle was <a href=#create>created</a> by the HiveMind community details from the creator are given.
<p>
If <a href=#clues>clues have been added</a> for a puzzle the authors are listed.  Click on an author name to see all of their clues.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>R</span></td><td>Show the rankings - from Beginner to ... Amazing to Genius to Queen Bee.  It also shows how many points are needed to get to the next rank.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>W</span></td><td>Show the found words in the order they were found.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>SC</span></td><td>Show how the score was tallied and how many words remain to be found.  A thin line shows where you first asked for a hint.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>C&nbsp;&nbsp;Y</span></td><td>Clear the puzzle and start over. <span class=cmd>C&nbsp;&nbsp;Y</span> means Clear and confirm with Yes.</td></tr>
</table>
<a name=hint_commands></a>
<h2>Hint Commands
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
It is <i>not</i> easy to find <i>all</i> the words in a puzzle
and reach the stratospheric height of the Queen Bee rank.
Most of us mere mortals need kind of some help to get to Amazing or Genius.
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>HT</span></td><td>Show the Hint Table.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TL</span></td><td>Show the Two Letter List.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>The Hint Table and the Two Letter List are explained <a href=#table_list>below</a>.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DP</span></td><td>Define the Pangrams.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DB8</span></td><td>Define the words beginning with B of length 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DTR</span></td><td>Define the words beginning with TR.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Definitions come from Merriam-Webster (<a target=nytbee
href='https://merriam-webster.com'>merriam-webster.com</a>)
and Oxford (<a target=nytbee href='https://lexico.com'>lexico.com</a>).  
If there there is a <a href=#clues>clue</a> for a word it is shown
instead of a dictionary definition.
<p></td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2><span class=cmd>D&nbsp;&lt;word&gt;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Define the word.
You can ask for definitions of <i>any</i> word - not just the ones in the puzzle.
No hints are tallied.
This form of the <span class=cmd>D</span> command serves as a quick and fun way to browse a dictionary that is more pleasant somehow than the full merriam-webster.com site.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D*&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></td><td>The above <span class=cmd>D</span> commands give at most 3 definitions. <span class=cmd>D*</span> will give them <i>all</i> plus any <a href=#clues>clues</a>.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V2P</span></td><td>Reveal the first two letters of the pangrams.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V3B8</span></td><td>Reveal the first 3 letters of the words beginning with B of length 8.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V4TR</span></td><td>Reveal the first 4 letters of the words beginning with TR.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>Using <span class=cmd>E</span> instead of <span class=cmd>V</span> reveals letters at the front and at the End of the word.  Commands that would reveal the entire word (like V4B4) are silently ignored (as are commands like V1B8 or V2TR).</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>Both define and reveal commands skip words that have already been found.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>1</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Hint Table.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>2</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Two Letter List.
<tr><td colspan=2>These will work even if the Table and List are not shown.<p></td></tr>
</table>

<h2>The Hint Table and the Two Letter List
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<p>
The <span class=green>Hint Table</span> (aka The Grid) (invoked with the <span class=cmd>HT</span> command) looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/hint_table.png>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>5</span> in the <b>M</b> row and the <b>6</b> column means that the the puzzle has <span class=blue>5</span> words beginning with <b>M</b> of length <b>6</b>.
<p>
The <span class=green>Two Letter List</span> (invoked with the <span class=cmd>TL</span> command) looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/two_letter_list.png>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>GE-4</span> means that the puzzle has <b>4</b> words beginning with <b>GE</b>.
<p>
There are <span class=red>two important things</span> 
about the table and list.
<ol>
<li>They are <b><i>DYNAMIC</i></b>.  As you discover and enter words,
the numbers in the table and lists will <i>change</i>.
The numbers represent the number of words that <i>remain</i> to be found.
<li>You can <b>click</b> on the entries in the table and lists to
get definitions <i>and clues</i> for the words.
</ol>
<p>
Another thing to know is the Power User command
<span class=cmd>CO</span> = COllapse.
This is a toggle to show or not show (collapse) the rows and columns
in the Hint Table that have no entries.  As you get closer to Queen Bee
it is fun to see the table shrink.
<a name=hint></a>
<h2>Hint Strategy
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = Queen Bee <i>all by myself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
There are many ways to get hints and
each increases your 'hint total'.
The number of hints are tallied like so:
<p>
<ul>
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><th>Command</th><th align=left colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;# hints</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>HT</span></td><td align=right>10</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TL</span></td><td align=right>5</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D,D*</span></td><td align=right>3</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V,E</span></td><td align=right>2</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>1</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>2</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>G&nbsp;Y</span></td><td align=right>5</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Some people do not mind how many hints they need to achieve Queen Bee.
It <i>is</i> just a game and they feel that games should be fun. &#128521;
If I make it to the rank of Amazing all by myself I call it a very good day.
And some days I consider it a success
if the Hints total is less than the Score. &#128522;

<h2>Create Your Own Puzzle to Share
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Why should Sam Ezersky be the only one to have the fun
(and responsibility) of puzzle creation?
<b>You</b> can create your <i>own</i> puzzle to share with the
HiveMind community.  To do so just click on the 'Create Puzzle' link
at the top of the main screen (right under 'Help').
You can also click on it here:
<a target=nytbee4 href='https://logicalpoetry.com/nytbee/mkpuz.html'>Create Puzzle</a>.
<p>
There are 5 steps to create a puzzle:
<style>
li {
    margin-bottom: 3mm;
}
</style>
<ol>
<li>Choose a 'pangramic' word - a word with exactly 7 unique characters.
This ensures that there will be at least one pangram in your puzzle.
In the NYT puzzles the letter S does not occur at all but
here you <i>are</i> allowed to have an S in your word.
You can also use E and R in the same puzzle, if you wish.
<p>
How to find a pangramic word?  There are five different ways
to choose a word:
<ol style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'>
<li>On the page you will see links to 3 long
lists of pangramic words to choose from:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Pangrams from NYT Puzzles
<li>Pangramic words from a list of 10,000 common English words
<li>Pangramic words from a large lexicon
</ol>
These lists are disjoint.
<li>It is overwhelming to be confronted with such a large number
of word choices.  It's nice to be offered a smaller number.
On the page you'll see an <span class=rand>R5</span>
after the above 3 lists. They are links.
Clicking on them will show you 5 random pangramic words from that file.
Pressing Return will give you 5 more.
<li>If you have a word that you want to appear in the puzzle
you can search for pangramic words whose resulting puzzle
could have that word as part of the solution.    There is a second
text field for this purpose.
<p>
For example, the word '<span style="color: purple">enigma</span>' yields
'<span class=green>magazine</span>' from the NYT puzzles, '<span class=green>demanding examining messaging remaining</span>'
from the 10,000 word list, and 54 (!) words from the large lexicon - most
of which are too esoteric for a "reasonable" puzzle.
However &#128522; ... among those 54 I do see these that are quite reasonable:
<ul class=green>
<li>beaming
<li>egomania
<li>imagines
<li>maddening
<li>margarine
<li>menacing
<li>menagerie
<li>migraine
<li>mismanage
</ul>
<li>You can simply enter 7 unique letters and and see if there are any words in the lists that use those 7.  Try, for example, <span class=green>abclrne</span>.
<li>Let's say you have a friend named Bob Smith.  Notice that there are
exactly 7 unique letters in his name.  There are no pangramic words
in any of the above lists that use the letters 
<span class=green>bhimost</span> but we
can still proceed with making a puzzle for Bob.  Enter bobsmith
as the pangramic word and choose a center letter.
The "word" <span class=green>Bobsmith</span>
will be added to the "Other qualified" words and I'm sure you can
come up with a clever clue for Bobsmith that will make Bob Smith smile &#128522;.
</ol>
<li>Given your pangramic word, tallies are done of words, scores, 4 letter words, and pangrams by center letter.
Analyze these and choose a center letter.
<li>Choose which words to include in your puzzle.  This is the most
difficult part.  If you <i>don't</i> include a common word or <i>do</i>
include a very rare or esoteric word you may be subject
to questioning and possible derision. &#128521;
Surprisingly, there are many common ordinary words that have not yet been used
in any NYT Puzzle.
You do not need to include <i>all</i> common ordinary words.
This is your own custom personalized puzzle and you can make your own rules!
<li>Give clues for the words, if you wish.  See the <a href=#clues>next section</a> for
more details on entering the clues.
<li>Lastly, give your Name and Location.
</ol>
When these steps are complete your puzzle is assigned
a number and is immediately available to the community.
This number is used when giving the <span class=cmd>CP&lt;num&gt;</span> command.
CP here stands for Community Puzzle - a puzzle created by you for the HiveMind community!
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>YCP</span> will list the community puzzles
that you have created.  You can click on the <span class=blue>CP#</span> link
to re-edit your puzzle.  You can update/change/delete the words and clues - but not the 7 letters or center letter.
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>XCP&lt;num&gt;</span> can be used to <i>delete</i> puzzles
that <i>you</i> have created.

Getting dictionary definitions for words with the
<span class=cmd>D</span> command
is nice &ndash; even though some people would consider it 'cheating' &#128521;.
Even more fun is to look at <b>clues</b> generously provided by the
members of the HiveMind.  These clues are often humorous and clever
wordplay - as in crossword puzzle clues.
<p>
You can write clues when you create a Community Puzzle as seen <a href=#create>above</a>.
You can <i>also</i> create clues for NYT Puzzles.
When the current puzzle is an NYT Puzzle choose the
<span class=blue>Add Clues</span> link
at the top.  There are several things to note:
<ul>
<li>Only the words you have found are shown.
<li>No need to give clues for <i>every</i> word.
<li>You can get dictionary definitions of the words to give
you some ideas.
<li>If you have given clues for a word before (such as for
frequently occuring words
like LOLL, NOON or TOOT) your clues will be offered and you can
cycle through them.
<li>Emojis on OSX can be inserted into clues with control-command-space.
</ul>
When you have finished with your clues they are all presented in a nice format.
In fact, there are 5 <i>different</i> nice formats in which to see your clues.
Choose your preferred format and then click on 'Ok'.  This will do two things:
<ol>
<li>Clear the format choices.
<li>Copy the clues onto the system clipboard.
</ol>
Then, if you wish, you can Paste your clues into the HiveMind forum.
In this way your clues can benefit those
people who are playing Spelling Bee with the NYT app or
the standard NYT web application.
<p>
When <i>playing</i> an NYT Puzzle, if clues have been provided,
there will be a red asterisk <span class=red>*</span> after the date at the top.
<p>
Clues are shown when you use the <span class=cmd>D</span> command.
If multiple people have added clues for the word you will see them all together.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>I</span> (information) command will show the
names of people who submitted clues.
Clicking on an author's name will show the complete list of their clues.
Note that in this display,
if you've already found a word, that word is appended to the clue
and the whole line is in gray rather than black.  This helps you
focus on the clues for the words you have not yet found.
<p>
If there are clues from multiple authors they will be color-coded. &#128522;
<p>
The tradition in the HiveMind forum is that clues come in
the word alphabetical order and <i>can</i> have the length shown as well.
If you know this you have more information beyond the clue itself.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>CL</span> command will list the dates
of the NYT puzzles for which you have created clues. 
<p>
You can choose <span class=blue>Edit Clues</span> to update your clues.
If you leave all of the clue fields blank
your clue offering is effectively deleted.
<p>
If you simply want to make clues for today's puzzle
to copy/paste into the HiveMind forum there is this link:

Spoiler warning: This link will reveal <i>all</i> of the words.

The NY Times Spelling Bee concept has been a fertile source of challenge for
many clever software engineers.
<p>
<h4>Games You Can Play</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='https://swilliams.io/fun/hex/'>swilliams.io.fun/hex</a>
- A Javascript implementation.  Fast.  Clean code.
Uses a file of 1,500 pangramic words and a file of 10,000
common words.  A different puzzle each day.  No ranks.
No hint table.  Not NYT Puzzles so not 'curated'.  
Github repo is <a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/s-williams/Hexgame'>here</a>.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://freebee.fun'>freebee.fun</a>
is a free web version of the game that you can play!
Javascript and HTML/CSS.
It doesn't use NYT words so the word list is not 'curated'.
There is no hint table.
Source code in C is available for a command line version.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/philshem/open-spelling-bee'>Philip Shemella</a>

<h4>NY Times Puzzle Answers</h4>
The 7 sites below show the list of allowed words in the

The intention is to help people solve the puzzle or, more accurately,
see what words they missed.  Most have annoying ads. &#128542;

<h4>Code <i>Stolen</i> from the NY Times &#128127; &#128561;</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes-spellingbee.com'>nytimes-spellingbee.com</a> You can play it.  The interface is nearly <i>identical</i> to the NY Times - but no hint table.
It is even "branded" with the NYT logo.  What?
Yikes!  They <b>stole</b> the Javascript/CSS/HTML from nytimes.com and embedded
it in an iframe.  How did they get around the need to subscribe?
Clever, but evil somehow.

<h2>Without a Subscription?
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Is it illegal or unethical to play the NYT Spelling Bee puzzles without a subscription?
<p>
I <b>do</b> have a subscription to the Times.  It is a reliable,
trusted, and curated source of information.
Subscriptions help the many journalists stay focused on their story.
<p>
When the puzzle page is loaded into the web browser
the list of allowed words
<i>is</i> visible &ndash; if you know where to look.
This is what you will see in the HTML/Javascript page source:
<pre>
window.gameData = {
    "today": {
    "expiration": 1638345600,
    "displayWeekday": "Tuesday",
    "displayDate": "November 30, 2021",
    "printDate": "2021/11/30",
    "centerLetter": "h",
    "outerLetters": ["d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "validLetters": ["h", "d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "pangrams": ["goodnight", "hotdogging"],
    "answers": ["goodnight", "hotdogging", "dhoti", "doth",
        "godhood", "goth", "hiding", "high", "hind",
        "hinging", "hint", "hinting", "hitting", "hogging",
        "honing", "hood", "hooding", "hoodoo", "hoot",
        "hooting", "hotdog", "nigh", "night", "ninth",
        "nothing", "thigh", "thin", "thing", "thinning",
        "thong", "tight", "tithing", "tonight", "tooth"],
...
</pre>
So the words in the puzzle <i>are</i> available publicly each day.
The new mechanism I created is simply an alternate way
of using these words.

<h2>Same 7 Letters
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
In the large NYT Spelling Bee <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a> there are many puzzles that share the
same set of 7 letters and hence the same pangrams.   
For example, there are 3 that
have occurred on 5 different dates:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5 border=0>
<tr><td class='green bold'>ADFLMPU</td><td>06/26/18</td><td>10/28/19</td><td>03/07/20</td><td>06/06/20</td><td>07/02/20</td></tr>
<tr><td class='green bold'>BILMOTY</td><td>07/20/18</td><td>10/27/19</td><td>06/04/20</td><td>12/01/20</td><td>07/09/21</td></tr>
<tr><td class='green bold'>GNORTUW</td><td>08/17/18</td><td>05/02/19</td><td>12/16/19</td><td>03/20/20</td><td>02/04/21</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<table cellpadding=4>
<tr>
<th class=rt># 7 letter<br>sets</th>
<th class=rt># of<br>dates</th>
</tr>
<tr><td class=rt>3</td><td class=rt>5</td></tr>
<tr><td class=rt>35</td><td class=rt>4</td></tr>
<tr><td class=rt>97</td><td class=rt>3</td></tr>
<tr><td class=rt>184</td><td class=rt>2</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
<p>
The <span class=cmd>F</span> command finds other dates that use the
same 7 letters as in the current puzzle.
These other puzzles usually (but not always)
have a different center letter.
Note these identical puzzles: 08/03/19 and 08/24/20.

<h2>NYT Archival Puzzles
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The archive was gathered mostly from
<a target=nytbee href=https://nytbee.com>nytbee.com</a>.
It is now added to daily at 3:00 a.m. EST by extracting the words
from the New York Times site.  There are daily puzzles going all the way
back to May 29, 2018.
<p>
Which puzzles from the large archive to play?
You can get one at random with the <span class=cmd>NR</span> command or you could
choose one with various attributes like ones with the most points or the
fewest 4 letter words.
<p>
Starting an archival puzzle is simple.
Just enter the puzzle date (like 12/16/21)
in the text field where you would enter a word.

<h2>Known Issues
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
This software is made by one person, not a team of NYT engineers.
It has limitations and weaknesses.  Here are the known issues:
<ul>
<li>It is not easy to play this verson on a mobile phone. 
It is possible but not easy.
It's best with an actual keyboard on a laptop or desktop computer.
Note that with the ID command you <i>can</i> share your
identity between a mobile and a laptop.
<li>There is no forum for discussion about this new mechanism.
The NYT HiveMind Forum or a FaceBook group page could serve this purpose.
<li>Since you do not need to register and login (which is nice), your identity
is preserved in a 'cookie' (aka website data)
within your web browser.  As long as you
don't 'clear your cookies' you will be fine.  Your identity within the program
is only truly important if you have added clues or created a community puzzle.
You can play the game regardless.
<p>
All browsers have a way
to clear the history without removing the website data.  For example,
on Safari holding the Option (aka Alt) key while clearing the history will
Keep Website Data.  If you inadvertently clear your cookie (i.e. your identity)
<script>abcd('send me an email');</script> with your name and location and
I can help restore the cookie.
<p>
Note that the <span class=cmd>ID</span> <a href=#power>Power User command</a>
is a way to restore your identity yourself.
<li>If two people using the same computer
want to play separate games they
can use two different browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc) OR
simply reset the game with the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command.
<li>The software was not designed for high volume.
If the usage becomes high the response time would suffer.
The software would need to be redesigned and possibly rewritten.
<li>Finally, I know there are many unknown issues.  If you find them
please <script>abcd('let me know');</script>.
</ul>
