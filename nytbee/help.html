<h2>Introduction</h2>
The New York Times has had the Spelling Bee
puzzle in the print version of the weekly New York Times Magazine since 2014.
The daily <a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>
web version</a> launched on May 9, 2018.
Wikipedia has links to several <a target=nytbee href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Spelling_Bee'>stories about the game</a>
and the vibrant community of people who enjoy it (the “HiveMind”).
Many people play the game on their phone with the New York Times app.
<p>
Here is the NY Times version:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee1 href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee</a>
</ul>
Now there’s <i>another</i> way to play:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee2 href='https://ultrabee.org'>UltraBee.org</a>
</ul>
UltraBee has several 
<a href=#advantages>advantages</a>.
<p>
There are several <a href=#videos>videos</a> to show how it works.
<p>
Give it a try and <script>abcd('let me know');</script> what you think.

My name is Jon Bjornstad.  I live in Davis, CA.  I am 75 years old.
I retired from the corporate software world a few years ago
but I still very much enjoy the art of programming.
In short, I am an old Perl hacker.
When I saw the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a> of the NYT Spelling Bee
and realized that it was <i>static</i>, that it did not change as
you found words, I immediately thought, “That’s not right.  I can do better.”
And I have.  The complete source code for this project is on

<h2>How to Play
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<ul style='margin-top: 8px'>
<img height=270 src=pics/df_honeycomb.png>
<li>Create words using the 7 letters.
<li>Words must contain at least 4 letters.
<li>Words must include the center letter.
<li>Letters can be used more than once.
<p>
<li>The list of allowed words does not include words
that are obscure, hyphenated, or proper nouns.
<li>No cussing either, sorry.
<p>
<li>Score points to increase your rating.
<li>4-letter words are worth 1 point each.
<li>Longer words earn 1 point per letter.
<li>Each puzzle includes at least one “pangram” which uses every letter. These are worth 7 extra points!
</ul>
The “allowed list” is a finite list of words chosen by
the puzzle creator.  Your challenge is to find them all.
<p>
Finding <b>all</b> of the words is just one way to play.
There are other '<a href=#games>games within the game</a>' that are another
kind of fun challenge.

<h2>Words and Commands
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The new mechanism looks like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/new_look2.png width=550>
<p>
In the text field you enter words that satisfy the rules of the puzzle.
You can enter more than one word.  Press Return to see if the words are
acceptable.  Any error messages will appear above the text field.
Words you have found will appear below the text field in alphabetical order.
<p>
Pressing Return when the text field is empty will clear any messages.
If there are no messages to clear, the 6 outer letters will be permuted.
<p>
If you lose focus on the text field you can restore it by
hitting the Tab key.
<p>
There are several links on the page.
<ul>
<li><span class=blue>NYT</span> - a page to subscribe to the New York Times.
<li><span class=blue>January 11, 2022</span> - Issue the <span class=cmd>I</span> command for <span class=cmd>I</span>nformation about the puzzle.
<li><span class=blue>Help</span> - Show this document.
<li><a target=_blank href=cmds.html>Cmds</a> - Show the very long <a target=_blank href=cmds.html>list of commands</a> you can enter in the text field.
<li><a href=#forum>Forum</a> - Toggle <a href=#forum>Forum</a> mode to share your thoughts and see what other people have offered.
<li><a href=#definitions>Define</a> - Show the definition of a random word in the allowed list that has not yet been found.
<li><a href=#competition>Own</a> - Show which words <i>only you</i> have found - your own words.
<li><span class=blue>Top</span> - Show how other people have done with the puzzle - and how many hints they needed.  
<li><span class=blue>Standings</span> - This will show you how other
people are doing with the Extra words and introduces a bit of
<a href=#competition>fun competition</a>.
<li><a href=#donut>Donut</a> - Toggle <a href=#donut>Donut</a> mode to more easily look for <a href=#donut>Donut </a>words.
<li><a href=#bonus>Bonus</a> - Toggle <a href=#bonus>Bonus</a> mode to more easily look for <a href=#bonus>Bonus</a> words.
<li><a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> - This link may appear if the puzzle is a <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> puzzle.  It will toggle the <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> Table.
</ul>
For a very simple and minimalistic interface you can turn all of the above links <b>off</b>.  Enter these commands: <span class=cmd>HE</span>, <span class=cmd>LN</span>, <span class=cmd>WL</span>, and <span class=cmd>ST</span> (cycle through 4 types until the status is off).  And for ultimate purists the <span class=cmd>H</span> command will show the 7 letters inline.
<ul>
<img src=pics/minimal.png>
</ul>
Here are a few of the many commands you can enter in the text field:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>I</span></td><td>Show <span class=cmd>I</span>nformation about the puzzle including numbers of words, points, pangrams, and (maybe) <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a>.
Note that a pangram is termed “perfect” if it is 7 letters long.
<p>If the puzzle was <a href=#create>created</a> by the community (instead of the NYT) details from the creator are given.
<p>
If <a href=#clues>clues have been added</a> for a puzzle the authors are listed.  Click on an author name to see <i>all</i> of their clues.  There are 6 different formats you can choose from.  
<p>
There is also the word “<span class="color: blue">HiveMind</span>” which is a link to the forum of the NY Times.  Click on it to see the extended yet entertaining discussion about the puzzle.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>R</span></td><td>Show the <span class=cmd>r</span>ankings - from Beginner to ... Amazing to Genius to Queen Bee.  It also shows how many points are needed to get to the next rank.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>W</span></td><td>Show the found words in the order they were found.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>SC</span></td><td>Show how the score was tallied and how many words remain to be found.  A thin line shows where you first asked for a hint.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TOP</span></td><td>
Show the <a href=#screen_names>screen names</a> of people who have achieved
the ranks of Queen Bee down to Good Start for the current NYT puzzle.
Also shown are the number of <a href=#hint>hints</a> they needed.
If someone achieved <a href=#gn4l>GN4L or GOTN</a> this is noted.
<a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> achievements are shown for
<a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> puzzles.
<p>
There is a link “Share your score.” Clicking on it will copy
a description of your scores to the clipboard.
You can paste it into a text message or email
to share your score with your friends.
It looks like this:
<ul>
<pre>

</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a name=st></a>
<span class=cmd>ST</span></td><td>Cycle through the 4 types of puzzle <span class=cmd>st</span>atus: numeric, graphical, graphical plus statistics, or no status at all. Default is numeric.<p>
<ol>
<li>The numeric status looks like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/nstatus.png height=90>
<a name=graphical></a>
<p>
<li>The graphical status looks like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/gstatus.png height=150>
<p>
b - bingo<br>
p - pangrams<br>
w - words<br>
s - score<br>
h - hints<br>
<p>
The bingo line will appear only if the puzzle is a <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a>.
<p>
If the number of hints exceeds the number of words
the line of dots will be truncated and a <span style="font-size: 20pt">+</span> will be appended.
<p>
Note that words in <a href=#stash>the stash</a> and perfect pangrams are shown differently:
<p>
<img src=pics/pw.png style="width: 180px">
<p>
This shows that there are 3 pangrams, 2 of them are perfect, 2 have been found, and one is in the stash.  Another non-pangram word was also found giving a total of 3 found words, 2 of which are pangrams.
<li>The third type of puzzle status is graphical plus statistics.
Here is an example of the statistics:
<p>
<table cellpadding=2>
<tr><td align='right'>19</td> <td>words of</td> <td align='right'>48</td> <td align='right'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39%</td> <td align='right'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29</td> <td>more to find</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>114</td> <td>points of </td> <td align='right'>261</td> <td align='right'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43%</td> <td align='right'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;147</td> <td>more to find</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2 align=left>score 110</td><td colspan=3 align=left>4 points in stash</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>10</td><td align='left'>hints</td><td colspan=4 align=left>hints/score: 0.09</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<li>For those who want a minimal clean interface the last type of status is no status at all.
</ol>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>C&nbsp;&nbsp;Y</span></td><td>Clear the puzzle and start over. <span class=cmd>C&nbsp;&nbsp;Y</span> means Clear and confirm with Yes.<p>
Note that this clearing of hints will not change the number of “overall hints” that is shown with the <span class=cmd>TOP</span> command.</td></tr>

<h2>Screen Names and Your Identity
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
There is no need to register or login to this game.  This is nice.
ALL are welcome.
It is helpful, however, to have <i>some</i> form of identification.
To address this need there are <b>screen names</b> and an
<b>identity</b> string - both of which are initially assigned to you.
<p>
The screen name is your unique <i>public</i>-facing name.
The identity string is <i>private</i>, secret, and unique.
Note that <i>neither</i> of these require an email address
or phone number so you can be as private and secure as you like.
<h3>Screen Name</h3>
For fun, the randomly assigned screen name is composed of
one of these Bee related words:
<ul>
Hive Bee Queen Worker Drone Honey Bumble Apian Buzz
</ul>
plus a number. Like Queen3 or Buzz45.
<p>
Screen names are shown with the 
<span class=cmd>CW</span>
command which
shows the fun <a href=#competition>competition</a> for Extra Words.
They are also used when you post a message to the <a href=#forum>Forum</a>.
<p>
You can change your screen name at any time
with the command <span class=cmd>SN</span> like
so:
<ul>
SN CHARLIE
</ul>
<b>However</b>, <i>before</i> changing your screen name, you should
use the ID command (see below) to set your identity string.
<p>
The screen name can be almost <i>anything</i> you wish.  The only
restriction is that it cannot contain the characters &lt;, &gt;, or space.
Uniqueness is enforced.
The name is entered in ALL CAPS but is transformed like so:
<ul>
BEE_THE_ONE
</ul>
becomes:
<ul>
BeeTheOne
</ul>
The first letter is capitalized as are the letters after an underscore.
The other letters are in lower case.
<p>
Entering the <span class=cmd>SN</span> command by itself will show you
what your screen name is.
<a name=identity></a>
<h3>Identity String</h3>
The identity string is generated to be unique.  It is a long string
of characters like this:
<div class=long_string>963e4401-81eq-18ec-g81c-b1f85c942ex3<span></div>
<p>
This string is saved in your web browser data (aka cookies) so that if you
leave and return later your words and games are remembered.  Nice.
<p>
The unfortunate issue with this mechanism is that if you:
<ul>
<li>clear your web data and browser history,
<li>use a different browser, or
<li>use incognito/private pages
</ul>
a <i>new</i> identity string will be generated for you - and you will not see
your words and games. &#128542;
<p>
A better way to establish your identity is to create a string
that you know is (very likely) unique to you
(like your name plus your birthdate) and enter it with the <span class=cmd>ID</span> command. For
example:
<ul>
    <span class=cmd>ID</span> <span class=green>GERTIE4/30</span>
</ul>
Note that the identity string is <i>case-sensitive</i>.  As you type it you
will only see capital letters but the case of your typing does matter.
<p>
Now if your web data and browser history is cleared
or you use a different browser
you can easily re-establish your identity by <b>RE</b>-entering the above command.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>ID</span> command can be used if you mostly
play on your computer with a keyboard but also want to play on
your mobile phone when you are out and about.
Enter your <span class=cmd>ID</span>
command in both places and you will see your words and games in
both places.  Nice!
<p>
Entering the <span class=cmd>ID</span> command by itself will show you
what your identity string is.
<a name=mobile></a>
<h2>Playing on a Mobile Phone or Tablet
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
While it is easiest to play on a computer with a keyboard
it is <i>also</i> easy to play on a mobile phone or tablet.
I have an iPhone and
using the Safari browser with the text enlarged
(with the <span style="font-size: 12pt">A</span>A icon) to 150%
and holding the phone horizontally, 
this is what the screen looks like:
<p>
<img src=pics/nytbee_iPhone.png width=80% border=1>
<p>
Android phones will behave in a similar way.
If you are playing on an iPad or Tablet with a touch screen
you can use the <span class=cmd>MO</span> command to toggle into
“mobile mode”.
<p>
In this mobile mode the heading has been toggled off.
There are 9 command links to the right of the hexagon letters:
<span class=cmd>Stash</span>,
<span class=cmd>Define</span>,
<span class=cmd>Donut</span>,
<span class=cmd>Enter</span>,
<span class=cmd>Delete</span>,
<span class=cmd>Bonus</span>,
<span class=cmd>Top</span>,
<span class=cmd>Help</span>,
and <span class=cmd>Forum</span>.
<p>
Tapping on letters will copy them to the area on the right:
<p>
<img src=pics/laundry.png width=80% border=1>
<p>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Stash</span> to add the word to <a href=#stash>The Stash</a>.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Define</span> to do a <span class=cmd>DR</span> command to define a random unfound word.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Donut</span> to switch into <a href=#donut>Donut Mode</a>.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Enter</span> to submit the word.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Delete</span> to remove letters.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Bonus</span> to switch into <a href=#bonus_mode>Bonus Mode</a>.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Top</span> to issue the <span class=cmd>TOP</span> command.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Help</span> to bring up this document in a separate browser window.  
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Forum</span> to toggle <a href=#forum>Forum Mode</a>.
<p>
If you wish to enter a command, see the list of found words,
or view the Hint Table simply scroll down.
<h3>Inline Letters</h3>
If you are adept at texting with your thumbs you may prefer using the <span class=cmd>H</span> command to toggle between the hexagon and having the letters arranged in a line (as in normal words) – like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/laundry_h.png width=80% border=1>
<a name=space></a>
<h3>Space and Multiple Words</h3>
There is a hidden feature (aka Power User trick) when playing on a mobile phone.
See this screenshot:
<p>
<img src=pics/redspace1.png width=80% border=1>
<p>
See the red pentagonal shape?  It won’t be red on your screen
but tapping on that area will insert a space character.  This will
enable you to enter multiple words before Entering them – as illustrated.
When you have entered a lot of words the font will be reduced so you
can enter even <i>more</i> words!
<p>
<img src=pics/redspace2.png width=80% border=1>

Just for fun, (and because this document is already TL;DR = “too long; didn’t read”) here is the previous paragraph rewritten by <a target=_blank href='https://openai.com/chatgpt/'>chatGPT</a> in the style
of a <a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping'>Rap/Hip-Hop</a> artist and then in the style of <a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson'>Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>:

Yo, listen up,<br>I got a tip for ya,<br>
See that pentagonal shape,<br>it’s fire, ya hear me?<br>
Ain’t gonna be red on your screen,<br>but don’t you forget,<br>
Tap that area, and you’ll get a space,<br>you won’t regret,<br>
<p>
It’s like a key to unlock,<br>the multi-word flow,<br>
Enter as many as you want,<br>before you hit go,<br>
As shown, it’s like a demo,<br>of what you can do,<br>
Type away, and the font’ll shrink,<br>so you can get it through,<br>
<p>
You can enter all your thoughts,<br>without a single pause,<br>
The font’ll adjust,<br>so you can keep on applause,<br>
So tap that shape,<br>and let the words start to flow,<br>
You’ll be typing like a pro,<br>in no time, yo!

Behold! The pentagonal form, a symbol of the infinite, beckons thee to tap upon its sacred space. Though the hue of red may not be visible to thine eyes, the essence of its power remains. By touching this consecrated area, a void is created, a space character that invites the flow of thought and idea.
<p>
Thus, the boundaries of expression are expanded, and the mind is free to roam, unencumbered by the constraints of the physical realm. The multitude of words, like a river’s tributaries, converge and flow into the vast ocean of thought, as illustrated by the sages of old.
<p>
And when the vessel of expression is filled to overflowing, the font, like a wise and benevolent guide, adjusts its proportions, that even more of the divine effluence may be contained, and the soul’s grandeur be revealed in all its majesty.
</div>
Yeah.  Note that when clicking on the pentagon it will briefly
flash pink to visually indicate that the space <i>was</i> inserted.

<tr><td colspan=2><span class=cmd>D&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;word&gt;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Define the word.
You can ask for definitions of <i>any</i> word - not just the ones in the puzzle.
No hints are tallied.
This form of the <span class=cmd>D</span> command serves as a quick and fun way to browse a dictionary that is more pleasant somehow (less clutter and noise!) than a full web site.  You can give multiple words on the command line.
<p>
You can also type a word <i>followed by</i> <span class=cmd>D</span> to get the definition:
<ul>
    D JUICE
</ul>
or
<ul>
    JUICE D
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Definitions are from <a target=nytbee href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>.  These definitions are very brief because they’re just a hint.  Complete definitions would cover multiple meanings and multiple parts of speech.  Once a word is found and shown in the Found Word List you can click on it again to see the brief definition.<a href=#hotlink><sup class=red>†††</sup></a>
The command <span class=cmd>Q</span> (or <span class=cmd>?</span>) will show the definition of the last word that was found.
<p>
Click on brief definitions to see the <i>complete</i> definition from wordnik.com in another window.  And (a hidden feature) if you’d like to hear the word pronounced aloud click on the word at the top of the complete definition.  For some reason, this works for root words but not derivations (e.g. change not changing).
<p>
If there there is a <a href=#clues>clue</a> for a word it is shown
first followed by the dictionary definition.  
The power user command
<span class=cmd>OC</span>
will toggle between seeing <span class=cmd>o</span>nly the <span class=cmd>c</span>lues or seeing <i>both</i>
the clues and the definitions.  The default is to show both.
You are normally charged 3 hint points for a definition but if
you have set Only Clues the charge is reduced to 2 hint points.
<p>
If you do not want to accidentally get definitions there is the

<h2>The Hint Table, Two Letter List, Three Letter List, and the Jumble Table
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<p>
The <span class=green>Hint Table</span> (aka The Grid) (invoked with the <span class=cmd>HT</span> command) looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/hint_table2.png width=370>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>4</span> in the <b>T</b> row and the <b>5</b> column means that the the puzzle has <span class=blue>4</span> words beginning with <b>T</b> of length <b>5</b>.
<p>
The <span class=green>Two Letter List</span> (invoked with the <span class=cmd>TL</span> command) looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/two_letter_list2.png width=280>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>TI-2</span> means that the puzzle has <b>2</b> words beginning with <b>TI</b>.
<p>
There are <span class=red>two important things</span> 
about the table and list.
<ol>
<li>They are <b><i>DYNAMIC</i></b>.  As you discover and enter words,
the numbers in the table and lists will <i>change</i>.
The numbers represent the number of words that <i>remain</i> to be found.
<li>You can <b>click</b> on the entries in the table and lists to
get definitions <i>and clues</i> for the words.
</ol>
<p>
For those who work on the puzzle at nytimes.com or with
the NYT mobile app and would like the Hint Table and Two Letter List
to be dynamic there <i>is</i> a solution:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee href='https://ultrabee.org/bee'>ultrabee.org/bee</a>
</ul>
Select and Copy the words you have found, Paste them into the text field,
and hit Return.   The Table and List will show
<i>only</i> the missing words.  This applies, of course, only
to today’s puzzle.   Duplicate, invalid, and stray words will be
silently ignored.
<p>
The <span class=green>Three Letter List</span> is invoked with the <span class=cmd>T3</span> command and looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/three_letter_list2.png width=500>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>NOR</span> means that there is 1 word beginning with <b>NOR</b>.  As you might expect, you can click on the <span class=blue>NOR</span> to get brief definitions (and/or clues).  This list is dynamic as well.
<p>
The Three Letter List is not a standard part of the NYT Puzzle.  It <i>is</i> often provided by various people in the HiveMind comments.
It almost gives <i>too</i> many hints since you only need to add one letter to get the 4 letter words!
<a name=jumble></a>
<p>
The <span class=green>Jumble Table</span> is invoked with the <span class=cmd>JT</span> command and looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/jumble_table.png width=540>
</ul>
Words that have not yet been found are shown jumbled up (aka scrambled, shuffled, anagrammed).  The circled <span class=blue>IOHNNRT</span> is a jumbled version of TINHORN &#128522;.
It is guaranteed that the jumbled words are not the actual words.
As before, you can click on the jumbled words to get brief definitions (and/or clues).
Definitions for jumbled words are charged the same number of
hint points as clicking on entries in the other hint table and lists.
<p>
The commands <span class=cmd>JR</span>
and
<span class=cmd>5J</span> show a random jumbled word and a 5+ letter jumbled word respectively and will work whether or not the Jumble Table is present.
<p>
The Jumble Table was inspired by the <a target=_blank href='https://beebox.ghost.io'>Spelling Bee Toolbox</a> written by Kevin Kolb.
<a name=hint></a>
<h2>Hint Strategy
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = <span class=cmd>Q</span>ueen <span class=cmd>B</span>ee <i><span class=cmd>a</span>ll <span class=cmd>b</span>y <span class=cmd>m</span>yself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
There are many ways to get hints and
each increases your
“hint total”.
The number of hints are tallied like so:
<p>
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Hint Command</th><th align=left colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;# hints</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>JT</span></td><td align=right>20</td></tr>

</ul>
Some people do not mind how many hints they need to achieve Queen Bee.
It <i>is</i> just a game and they feel that games should be fun. &#128521;
If I make it to the rank of Amazing all by myself I call it a very good day.
And some days I consider it a success
if the Hint total is less than the Score. &#128522;
<p>
If you are seeing Only Clues (see the <span class=cmd>OC</span> command)
the definitions are 2 hint points per word rather than 3.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>I</span> (info) command
shows the names of the people who provided <a href=#clues>clues</a>.
Clicking on a name will show <i>all</i> of their clues.
This will not cost you any hint points <i>at all</i>
and is one of many ways that you can “<a href=#cheat>cheat</a>”!
<p>
Note that with enough hints you can <i>always</i> make it to Queen Bee.
For example, with the 5 letter word MAGMA you could ask
for the hints V4MA and E2MA to get all 5 of the letters.
<p>
<a name=hint_ratio></a>
Once the rank of Amazing is reached the ratio of hints
to total score is shown.  Here’s an example of where I struggled
to get to Queen Bee after I got to Genius &#128549;:

<h2>Games within the Game
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Achieving “Queen Bee All By Myself” (QBABM) is the ultimate goal but
for most of us mere mortals it is rarely achieved.
There <i>are</i> other fun ways to play:
<ul>
<li>The Pangram Game - Get random games (with the command <span class=cmd>NR</span>) and find all of the pangrams.  The commands <span class=cmd>DP</span> and <span class=cmd>V1P</span> can help.  You can periodically clear
your list of games with the <span class=cmd>XA</span> command.
<li><a href=#gn4l>Genius No 4 Letter</a> (GN4L) - Find only 5+ letter words to reach the Genius level.  
The commands <span class=cmd>51</span>,
<span class=cmd>52</span>,
<span class=cmd>53</span>,
<span class=cmd>5J</span>,
and <span class=cmd>D5</span> can help.  You can also try for GOTN (On the Nose).
<li><a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> - Get random Bingo games (with the command <span class=cmd>NRB</span>) and try for the various levels of Bingo achievement.  The command <span class=cmd>BT</span> can help.
<li>Don’t worry about your hint total and just keep asking for hints
(via the <span class=cmd>D</span>, <span class=cmd>V</span>, and <span class=cmd>E</span> commands) until you get to Queen Bee.   This is
still an accomplishment!  Using brief definitions to find words
is a way to challenge and enlarge your vocabulary.
You can use <span class=cmd>DR</span> to get definitions <i>and</i> any clues for random unfound words.
<li>You could do <i>all</i> of the above
by resetting the puzzle between the games with the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command.
<li>Find all the words and get to Queen Bee however you want
and then reset the game (with <span class=cmd>C Y</span>) and see if you can
remember the words.  If you keep doing this your <a href=#hint_ratio>hint ratio</a> should get lower and lower.
<li>Find as many <a href=#bonus>Bonus</a> words as you can.
There is, of course, no “official” list of
these words but you can tell your friends about how many you found.
You can also search for <a href=#donut>Donut</a>
and Lexicon words.
Searching for these “Extra” words is, for me,
a more creative and fun
way to spend WordPlay time that is much more diverting than simply
finding words that someone else has chosen and hidden from you. &#128540;
The <span class=cmd>CW</span> command will show you how other
people are doing with the Extra words and introduces a bit of
<a href=#competition>fun competition</a>.
Another little game is to try to maximize your <a href=#boa>BOA Score</a>.
Note that the command <span class=cmd>C Y</span> clears puzzle words but
not the Extra words.  If you want to start <i>completely</i> fresh the
command <span class=cmd>C YA</span> will clear <i>all</i> words.
<li>A different kind of activity is to find all the words in today’s puzzle
(however you wish, even with the <span class=cmd>G YP</span> command &#128556;) and
then add some clever inventive <a href=#clues>clues</a>.
This will help everyone else
who is playing the game with this software.  You can also copy and paste
your clues into the NYT Spelling Bee forum to help the larger world-wide HiveMind.
<li>Finally, you could <a href='#create'>create your own puzzle</a> and
give it as a gift to one of your friends.  Their name could be one of the pangrams - or one of the words in the allowed list! &#128525;
</ul>
<a name=bingo></a>
<h2>Bingo
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
If each of the 7 letters in a puzzle is the first letter of at
least one word in the
list of allowed words then this is called a “Bingo”.
It is called “Bingo” in reference to the real <a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)'>Bingo</a> game where
you win if you complete a row, column, or diagonal.
Not all puzzles are Bingo puzzles but there are many.
In the first 1530 puzzles in the <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a>
650 were Bingo puzzles.
The <span class=cmd>I</span> command will tell you if a puzzle is a Bingo as
does the graphical status (<a href=#st>see the command <span class=cmd>ST</span></a>).
When you enter a word that completes a Bingo you get a congratulatory message.
There are 4 levels of Bingo achievement:
<ul>
1 - YES, you achieved a BINGO! &#128077;<br>
2 - In the FIRST 7 words you found! &#128077; &#128077;<br>
3 - Even better, they were found in ALPHABETICAL order! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
4 - AND with a MINIMUM score! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
 or<br>
4 - AND with a MAXIMUM score! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;
</ul>
Trying to achieve these levels of Bingo are little games
within the game that some people enjoy.  It is much easier than QBABM!
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>BT</span> (Bingo Table) shows a subset of the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a>.  For each of the 7 letters it shows the <i>lengths</i> of the words with minimum and maximum <i>scores</i>.  This helps when you are aiming for level 4 Bingo.  For example (from 1/22/21):
<ul>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>C</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>E</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>I</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>N</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>O</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>T</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>V</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=rt>Min</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
<td class='rt blue'>5</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
<td class='rt blue'>5</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=rt>Max</td>
<td class='rt blue'>10</td>
<td class='rt blue'>8</td>
<td class='rt blue'>12</td>
<td class='rt blue'>8</td>
<td class='rt blue'>5</td>
<td class='rt blue'>8</td>
<td class='rt blue'>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class='red rt'>*</td>
<td class='red rt'>*</td>
<td class='red rt'>*</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>
In this puzzle the word INCONVENIENCE (13) is longer than <span class=green>INCONVENIENT</span> (12) but the latter is a pangram.  Numbers marked with a red asterisk represent words that are pangrams.
<p>
<span class=cmd>BT</span> does not tally any <a href=#hint>hint points</a>.
For people striving for QBABM the Bingo table <i>does</i> give you quite
a bit of help &ndash; for free.  
You can’t <i>quite</i> claim that you got to Queen Bee
<i>all by yourself</i>, but that’s okay.
<p>
As in the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a> the numbers in the BT table are <i>links</i> - to show a brief definition of the word(s). <span class=cmd>BT</span> is a toggle - the default is off.
If a puzzle is not a Bingo no table will be shown.
<p>
If you are using the <a href=#graphical>graphical status</a> note that you can click on the
'b' (bingo) line to toggle the Bingo Table on and off.
<p>
If you enjoy Bingo games there is the command <span class=cmd>NRB</span> which will start a <span class=cmd>N</span>ew <span class=cmd>R</span>andom <span class=cmd>B</span>ingo puzzle from the NYT <a href='#nyt_archive'>archive</a>.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>TOP</span> command shows Bingo achievement scores that are tallied like this:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=2>
<tr><td>First 7 words</td><td>&nbsp;1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alphabetical Order</td><td>&nbsp;2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Minimum Score</td><td>&nbsp;4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Maximum Score</td><td>&nbsp;8</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
The maximum Bingo score in <span class=cmd>TOP</span> is 18: min (1 + 2 + 4) + max (1 + 2 + 8) = 18.
The total number of hints needed is also shown.
Note that to do both min and max Bingo you need the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command between them.
<span class=cmd>SWA</span> is better than <span class=cmd>C Y</span> - see <a href=#stash>The Stash</a>.
<p>
Even better and more convenient, after a Minimum Score Bingo the message will contain a link: "On to Max Bingo" which will do the 'SWA' for you.
And after a Maximum Score Bingo the message will contain a link: "On to GN4L" which will stash any four letter words and unstash any 5+ letter words and ... turn off the Bingo Table.
<a name=gn4l></a>
<h2>Genius No 4 Letter
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Another little game within the game is achieving the rank of Genius
without any 4 letter words.  The abbreviation for this in the HiveMind forum
is GN4L (<span class=cmd>G</span>enius <span class=cmd>N</span>o <span class=cmd>4</span> <span class=cmd>L</span>etter).
<p>
Since 4 letter words are only valued at 1 point, attaining GN4L is almost always possible.
In the first 1530 games in the <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a> there were
only 8 games where GN4L was <i>not</i> possible. 10/8/19 is one example.
If GN4L cannot be achieved this is noted in the output of the 'I' (info) command.
<p>
Even though it is almost always possible, getting to GN4L isn’t easy
and here are a few commands to help:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D5</span></td><td>Define a random word not yet found that has 5 or more letters.  Note that if you only have 5+ letter words in your found list the DR command will do much the same as the D5 command.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>51</span></td><td>Show a random non-zero entry from the Hint Table where the length is 5 or more.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>52</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Two Letter List of words with a length of 5 or more.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>53</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Three Letter List of words with a length of 5 or more.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>5J</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Jumble Table of words with a length of 5 or more.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
When you achieve GN4L you get a congratulatory message:
<ul>
Genius &#128077;&#128077;<br>
And you did it without ANY 4 letter words! &#128522;
</ul>
<a name=gotn></a>
A minor (relatively easy) variation on GN4L is GOTN - <span class=cmd>G</span>enius <span class=cmd>O</span>n <span class=cmd>T</span>he <span class=cmd>N</span>ose.
This is where your point total is <i>exactly</i> at the beginning
of the Genius level.  Genius is 70% of the maximum point total (Queen Bee).
GOTN requires that you achieve GN4L at the same time.  There is
this additional congratulatory message for GOTN:
<ul>
On the Nose! <span style='font-size: 24pt'>&#128067;</span> &#128522;
</ul>
<p>
Two other Genius level variants are when you did not need
a Pangram to reach Genius.  The codes for these are: GN4L-NP and GOTN-NP.
If GN4L-NP is not possible this is also noted in the I (info) command.
<p>
<ul>
And with No Pangrams! &#128526; &#128588;
</ul>
<p>
The <span class=cmd>PG</span> command will tell you how many more points you need to reach the Genius level. If you are at or over Genius it reports how many more words you need to reach Queen Bee.
<p>
As you get close to Genius you can consult the Hint Table to see if there is a 5+ letter word remaining that will get you to Genius exactly.  If not, you could <i>stash</i> a word with the <span class=cmd>SW</span> command like this: <span class=cmd>SW</span> &lt;word&gt;.  This will adjust your score so you can then have other ways to make the score match the Genius level exactly. 
<a name=stash></a>
<h2>The Stash
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
When striving for <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> or <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a>
you can effectively use "the stash".  The Stash is a place you can
store words that you have found but don’t want to enter quite yet.
Let’s say you are trying for minimal <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> with
this puzzle:
<p style="margin-left: .5in">
<img width=250 src=pics/stash.png>
</p>
There are several 4 letter words in the <span class=cmd>BT</span>
table.  As you are looking for them you might see a pangram
or 5+ letter words that do not fit in with minimal Bingo.
You can “stash” these words
so you don’t forget them!
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SW CONDITION ADDICT DICTA</spaN>
</ul>
<span class=cmd>SW</span> stands for <span class=cmd>S</span>tash <span class=cmd>W</span>ords.
<p>
More conveniently, the <span class=cmd>SW</span> (or just an S) could be entered <i>at the end</i>, if you wish:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CONDITION ADDICT DICTA SW</span><br>
or<br>
<span class=cmd>CONDITION ADDICT DICTA S</span>
</ul>
<p>
Note that words are checked before stashing.  Only valid puzzle
words are stashed.  Extra words will be added as usual.
<p>
Note that if you see a Bonus or Donut word
it’s okay to enter them <i>whenever</i> you wish.
The <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command will <i>not</i> clear them.
<p>
When you finish with minimal Bingo you likely want to
go on to maximal Bingo (which is much harder) or <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a>.
But you don’t want to
forget the 4 letter words you entered!  There is a command to help:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SWA</span>
</ul>
This will stash <span class=cmd>a</span>ll of your puzzle words.
<p>
The words in the Stash are shown below the Donut, Lexicon, and Bonus words.
Something like this:
<ul>
Stash: Acid Addict Coda Condition Dicta Data ...
</ul>
When you go on to <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a> you can add all of
the 5+ letter words in the stash with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA5</span>
</ul>
The stash will now contain only 4 letter words:
<ul>
Stash: Acid Coda Data ...
</ul>
When you reach reach Genius and <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a> you can now enter
your remembered 4 letter stash words with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA</span>
</ul>
<span class=cmd>SA</span> stands for <span class=cmd>S</span>tash <span class=cmd>A</span>dd.  <i>All</i> words will be UNstashed.
<p>
There is a variant on the <span class=cmd>SA</span> command:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA XX</span>
</ul>
XX can be any letters you wish.   Only the words in the stash
that <i>contain</i> an XX will be UNstashed.  This would be useful if
you saw a pangram during minimal bingo and stashed it and then you wanted
to enter the pangram when doing maximal bingo.  Without this command
you would have to re-enter it.  For example, the pangram for the
above puzzle is ADDICTION. If the stash contained:
<ul>
ACIDIC ADDICT ADDICTION ANACONDA CICADA 
</ul>
you could UNstash ADDICTION with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA TI</span><br>
or<br>
<span class=cmd>SA IO</span>
</ul>
<p>
Another (and likely easier) way to UNstash a word is to first click
on it to get its definition.  Above the definition there will be
a link labeled <span class=blue>UNstash</span>.  Click on it do the unstashing.
<ul>
<img src=pics/unstash.png height=100 border=1>
</ul>
A fun variant of this is when you want to stash a word that
is already in your list of <i>found</i> puzzle words - perhaps
to help achieve <a href=#gotn>GOTN</a>.  Click on the word for a definition.
You will have a link labeled <span class=blue>Stash</span>.
<p>
For power users: In the command <span class=cmd>SA XX</span> the XX is actually a <a target=_blank href='https://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut'>Perl regular expression</a> (with the /x flag) so with this in the stash:
<ul>
CHALLAH CHALLENGE HALL HANG LEECH TENT
</ul>
You could unstash CHALLENGE with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA E$</span>
</ul>
because it is the only word that ends in E.
And you could unstash LEECH with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA ^L</span>
</ul>
because it is the only word that begins with L.

<h2>Donut, Lexicon, and Bonus Words
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<h3>Donut</h3>
While searching hunting foraging for words that are in the “allowed list”
it often happens that you see a real word that does not contain the center
letter.  These words are called “Donut Words” because the 6 non-center letters
form a circle (or torus) with a hole - like a donut or 
<a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut'>doughnut</a>.
This puzzle from May 27, 2022:
<p style="margin-left: .2in">
<img width=370 src=pics/donut.jpg>
</p>
had more than 50 (!) Donut Words including Again, Agar, Agrarian,
<span class=purple>Arming</span>,
<span class=green>Grammarian</span>,
and <span class=purple>Margin</span>.  Another Donut Word is “Anagram”
which had never occurred in an NYT Spelling Bee before - how fun is that! &#128522; (It has since been used for the first and only time on 9/24/23).
Note that <span class=purple>Arming</span>, <span class=green>Grammarian</span>, and <span class=purple>Margin</span> are <i>pangram</i> donut words because
they use all 6 letters.  <span class=purple>Arming</span> and <span class=purple>Margin</span> are <i>perfect</i> pangram donut words because they are 6 letters long.  
<p>
Donut Words are deemed acceptable if they occur in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon <span class=red>††††</span></a>
or have appeared before in an NYT Bee Puzzle
OR if they have a definition at
<a target=_blank href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>.
<p>
If you try to find Donut (or Lexicon) words by typing words that you don’t know
and suspect <i>may</i> be a valid word you may be pleasantly surprised
that it is indeed an acceptable word.  For example:
<p style="margin-left: .6in">
<img width=280 src=pics/teet.png>
</p>
So now you are probably wondering what TEET means, right?
You can click on the red <span style="color: red">TEET</span>
and a definition will be shown.  Nice!   Another way to see the definition
of the last word that was found is the <span class=cmd>Q</span> (or <span class=cmd>?</span>) command.
<p>
To faciliate your search for Donut words you can toggle into “Donut Mode” with the command <span class=cmd>DN</span>.   This will only show Donut words you have found and the center letter will disappear because you won’t be using it.  
When you toggle the letter display with <span class=cmd>H</span> to show the letters in a straight line the center letter will be omitted.  Toggle <i>out</i> of Donut Mode with the command <span class=cmd>DN</span> as well.
<p>
When playing on a <a href=#mobile>mobile phone</a> there are links to toggle into and out of Donut mode.  In Donut mode the screen looks like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/mobile_donut.jpg style="width: 80%" border=1>
<p>
Note: The center hexagon will issue a <i>space</i> so you can
enter multiple donut words at the same time.  The center hexagon will
briefly flash pink to indicate that the space <i>was</i> inserted.
<p>
When viewing the letters horizontally (with the <span class=cmd>H</span> command) they will look like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/mobile_donutH.png style="width: 80%" border=1>
<p>
Finally, the command <span class=cmd>D&gt;</span> will show the Donut
words in order by length.
<h3>Lexicon</h3>
Another type of word is one that IS a real valid actual proper qualified word
containing the center letter but which for some mysterious, arbitrary,
rational, or irrational reason was not included in the “allowed list”.
In this puzzle:
<p>
<img width=340 src=pics/donut.jpg>
<br>
the words WAIN and WANG are such valid words that
were not included in the allowed list - because they are rare or obscure?
These disallowed words are the subject of many many repetitous and lengthy
discussions and debates in the HiveMind Forum.  One example is
the word URTICARIA - see 
<a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/crosswords/spelling-bee-forum.html#commentsContainer'>the NYT HiveMind forum for May 16, 2022</a>.
These words are called “Lexicon Words” because they <b>are</b> to be found
in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>.
<a name=bonus></a>
<h3>Bonus</h3>
When seeking questing looking for words in the allowed list
how often have you muttered the phrase “<span class=green>If only I had an E...</span>”?
For this, there are <i>Bonus</i> words.  A Bonus word is at least 6
letters long, uses some of the 7 letters
(<i>not</i> necessarily including the center one),
and an <i>additional</i> letter that is <i>not</i> one of the 7.
<p>
In this puzzle from November 13, 2022:
<p style="margin-left: .4in">
<img src=pics/22-11-13.png width=300>
<p>
the words VICINIT<span class=red1>Y</span> and INCITE<span class=red1>M</span>ENT are Bonus words which use an additional Y and M respectively.
Bonus words must appear either in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>
or in the list of previous
NYT Puzzle words
OR if they have a definition at
<a target=_blank href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>.
The additional letter <i>can</i> be an <span class=red1 style="font-size: 20pt">S</span> (finally!).
<span class=red1>S</span>CIENCE is another Bonus word for the above puzzle. 
<p>
Note that very few plurals occur in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>
and that many words ending in ING and ED are absent as well.
<a target=_blank href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>
<i>does</i> have definitions for most plurals.
Since this would result in a plethora of Bonus words just by adding
an S (or ES) to Donut words that are nouns (or verbs) these type of Bonus words
are not allowed.  Apologies for those who enjoy accumulating vast
quantities of Bonus words. &#128522;
<p>
It seems that Bonus words are often more colorful and intriguing
than the typical boring “normal” puzzle words.
<p>
Playing Spelling Bee hopefully expands our vocabulary.
But … if you only play the standard puzzle your vocabulary
is biased by words with &lt;= 7 unique letters.
AND no words with S or both E & R. 😜
Bonus words expand that a little.
<p>
On May 16, 2022 this was the NYT Puzzle:
<p>
<img src=pics/20220516.png width=280 style="margin-left: .5in">
<p>
And here is a screenshot from the NYT Spelling Bee HiveMind Forum on that day:
<p>
<img src=pics/nearly-words.png width=600 border=1>
<p>
This is evidence that Donut and Bonus words are a troublesome
issue for those who only play on the NY Times site!
On <i>this</i> site they are an added fun competitive challenge. &#128522;
<h4>Types of Bonus Words</h4>
<ul>
<li>A Bingo Bonus word
is a Bonus word that <i>begins</i> with the additional letter.
<li>A Super Bonus word is one that has 7 or more letters and includes the puzzle’s center letter.
<li>A <span class=green>Bonus Pangram</span> is one that uses all 7 letters plus the extra one.  In the above puzzle <span class=green>ARCHITECTURE</span> would be a Bonus Pangram.
<li>A <span class=purple>Perfect Bonus Pangram</span> is exactly 8 letters long.
<li>There is yet <span style="color: magenta"><i>another</i></span> type of Bonus Pangram – which I will leave
undocumented so you can have the pleasure of discovering it on your own.
</ul>
<p>
If you have found a rather long Bonus word and want to brag about it
the <span class=cmd>B&gt;</span> command will show the Bonus words in order
of increasing length.  This will obviate the annoying, laborious, and error prone counting of the letters! &#128522;
<a name=bonus_mode></a>
<h4>Bonus Mode</h4>
Searching for Bonus words on a mobile phone is somewhat awkward.
The additional letter is (of course!) not in the 7 displayed letters
so you would need to enter the words in the text field.
The onscreen keyboard occupies a lot of the screen real estate.
When you toggle Bonus Mode ON
the mobile display will look like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/doodad.png style="width: 80%" border=1>
<p>
The 19 (26-7=19) additional letters are put in a table.
Tap on them to append to the word.
If a Bonus word has been found using a letter it will
be shown in <span style='color: lightgreen'>lightgreen</span>.
If there is a Bingo Bonus word that begins with the
letter that letter will be shown in <span class=green>green</span>.
There are also command links for
<span class=cmd>Stash</span>,
<span class=cmd>Own</span>,
<s><span class=cmd>Bonus</span></s>,
<span class=cmd>Enter</span>,
<span class=cmd>Delete</span>,
and
<span class=cmd>Standings</span>.
<ul>
<li><span class=cmd>Stash</span>, <span class=cmd>Enter</span>, and <span class=cmd>Delete</span> have the usual functions.
<li><span class=cmd>Own</span> will issue the <span class=cmd>OW</span> command to show what words only you have found.
<li><s><span class=cmd>Bonus</span></s> will toggle OUT of Bonus Mode.
<li><span class=cmd>Standings</span> will issue the <span class=cmd>CW</span> command for you (see <a href=#competition>below</a>).
</ul>
<p>
When NOT on a mobile phone the <span class=cmd>BN</span> command 
will put the 19 additional letters above the list of Bonus words.
<p>
Similar to what happens in Donut Mode, when in Bonus Mode
only Bonus words are shown – no Puzzle, Donut, Lexicon or Stash words.
And since you are not looking for puzzle words, the
Status (numeric or graphical), Hint Table, Two Letter
List, Three Letter List, and Jumble Table are not shown.
This helps you focus on finding those elusive colorful intriguing Bonus words!
<a name=boa></a>
<h4>The BOA and BB Score</h4>
Can you find a Bonus word using <i>each</i> of the 19 additional letters?
Sometimes it is possible.  If there is no U in the puzzle you likely
cannot find a Bonus word using a Q.  J, X, and Z may not be possible either.
These letters <i>are</i> the highest value Scrabble letters for a reason!
The command <span class=cmd>BOA</span>
will show your <span class=cmd>B</span>onus words
in <span class=cmd>O</span>rder of the
<span class=cmd>A</span>dditional letter.  Appended to this list is
the count of how many additional letters were used in a
Bonus word - this is your BOA Score.
<p>
The number of additional letters with
a Bingo Bonus word is your BB score. This is also appended
to the output of the <span class=cmd>BOA</span> command.
<p>
When searching for Bonus words to increase your BOA score this list of words
from the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a> may help:
<ul>
<a target=_blank href=words23.html>6+ Letter Words with 2 or 3 Unique Letters</a>
</ul>
<h4>Scrabble</h4>
Looking for Bonus words is similar to
playing <a target=_blank href='https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules'>Scrabble</a>.  In Scrabble
you have 7 letters in your rack and you need to find <i>another</i> letter
already on the board to place your word.
Finding Bonus words is easier than Scrabble
because you can simply <i>choose</i> whatever other letter you need!
It’s also like having a blank tile in your rack and that tile
can be any letter you wish.
<h3>Extra Word Lists</h3>
These three types of words (the term “Extra Words” seems a good one) are
listed below the words you have found in the allowed list.  Like so:
<p style="margin-left: .2in">
<img src=pics/list3.png width=600>
<p>
Note that the command <span class=cmd>C Y</span> will clear puzzle words but
leave the Extra words.  <span class=cmd>C YA</span> will clear <i><span class=cmd>a</span>ll</i> words.
<h3>Global Lists of Extra Words</h3>
There is, of course, no “official” list of these Extra words.
This makes it more fun, in a way.  More creative.
Here are 7 commands to show the Extra words found by the
<i>entire</i> global world-wide community.
You cannot use these commands on the same day of the puzzle – otherwise, people
could “cheat” and use words found by others, yes?
The command <span class=cmd>Y</span> is convenient here to go
to yesterday’s puzzle.
The words that <i>you</i> found are shown in
<span class=found_bonus>sky blue</span>.
<span class=green>Pangrams</span> and <span class=purple>Perfect Pangrams</span> are marked.
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>DW</th><td>Show all Donut words in alphabetic order.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>LW</th><td>Show all Lexicon words in alphabetic order.</td></tr>

<tr><th class='cmd rt'>NBW</th><td>Show all Bonus words in order of how many different people found them.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>ABW</th><td>Show all Bonus words in order of the additional letter.  Within that additional letter the sort is by the number of people who found the word and then alphabetically. At the end are tallies of the number of words containing the center letter and also by length.</td></tr>
</table>
If you see a word you don’t know you can click on it to see a brief definition
(and then go back in the browser to see the list again) and, as usual, click on the brief definition to see a complete definition at wordnik.com.
<p>
Note: These lists of words can change <i>after</i> the day of the puzzle.
Furthermore, as a “very big cheat” you could select, copy, and paste all of the words into the text box to add to your collection.
<p>
<a name=competition></a>
<h3>Competition</h3>
Two commands that show how you are doing with respect to others:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>OW</th><td>This tells you which
Extra words were found <b><span class=cmd>O</span>nly By You</b>.<br>
When an extra word is entered you are informed if it is an “Own” word.
<ul>
<span style="color: red">WORLDLY</span>: Bonus Own word &#128077;
</ul>
Of course, someone else may enter it later so it may not <i>stay</i> an Own word.
</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt' style="width: 15mm">CW</th><td>Community Words.
The 'C' could also stand for Competitive &#128522;.
Show the <a href=#screen_names>screen names</a>
of the 5 people who found the most
Extra words (Bonus, Donut, and Lexicon) for the current NYT puzzle.
For example:
<br>
<img src=pics/cw.png width=500 style="margin: 2mm">
<br>
<span class=cmd>CW 10</span> will show the top 10.
Note that this command only shows the counts of words that were found <b>on</b>
the day the puzzle was released.  This command <i>can</i> be
entered throughout the day of the puzzle.
<span class=cmd>CW</span> introduces
a fun competitive drive to try to find more and more words.
<p>
Note that <span class=cmd>CW</span> also shows OW, BOA, and BB scores.
</td></tr>
</table>
<a name=incorrect></a>
<h2>Incorrect Words
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
In addition to Puzzle, Donut, Bonus, and Lexicon words
another category of words is Incorrect words.
These are words that were tried but were not found in the allowed list
nor in the large lexicon nor in
<a href='https://www.wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a> or for some other reason
were not accepted. Similar to <span class=cmd>BW</span> and <span class=cmd>NBW</span> there are commands
<span class=cmd>IW</span> and <span class=cmd>NIW</span> to show the accumulated Incorrect words.  There are four differences:
<ul>
<li><span class=cmd>IW</span> and <span class=cmd>NIW</span> can be entered <i>on</i> the day of the puzzle.
<li>You cannot click on the words to get a definition.
<li>You can give a prefix parameter - like <span
class=cmd>IW T</span> - to only show words that <i>begin</i> with
the parameter.  This might actually be useful &#128522;.
For example, if you are looking for a T5 word (for Bingo
purposes) you can see what words others have tried that
didn’t work and this may give you a clue for the word you
are seeking.  Giving the T parameter saves you from having
to scroll through all the other incorrect words.
<li>Words that you tried are not highlighted.
</ul>
<p>
These commands show how inventive and desperate we are to
find more and more words! &#128522;

<h2>Misspellings, Images, and a Vocabulary Challenge
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Three fun things that may be useful, diverting, or educational:
<p>
1) The puzzle on <a  target=_blank href='https://ultrabee.org/cgi-bin/nytbee.pl/20210206'>2/6/21</a> included the word ANEMONE
which was also a Bonus word for the <a target=_blank href='https://ultrabee.org/cgi-bin/nytbee.pl/20241214'>12/14/24</a> puzzle.
I find this word to be very tricky to spell correctly.
I tried ANENOME and got these errors:
<br>
<img src=pics/ane1.png width=380px>
<img src=pics/ane2.png width=380px>
<br>
At this point if you click on the <span class=red1>red</span>
misspelled word, a new
window will open with a Google search on that word.  You will see:
<p>
<ul>
<img src=pics/ane3.png width=600px>
</ul>
Google is very good at respelling misspelled words.
So the correct spelling is ANEMONE.  That’s helpful, yes?
<p style='margin-top: .5in;'>
2) Whenever you are viewing a definition of a word (say CARROT)
there will be a link labelled <span class=blue>Search</span>:
<br>
<img style='margin-left: 6mm; margin-top: 2mm;' src=pics/carrot.png>
<br>
Clicking on <span class=blue>Search</span> will open
a new window with a Google search for CARROT.  In that window
you will see a link ‘Images’ to show a collection of images of carrots:
<p>
<img src=pics/carrots.png>
<p>
Fun, huh?  Useful? Maybe.
<p style='margin-top: .5in;'>
3) If, after enjoying today’s puzzle you are up for a
vocabulary “test”, you can go to yesterday’s puzzle
(with the command <span class=cmd>Y</span>) and issue the
command <span class=cmd>BW</span> to see the long list of
intriguing colorful creative Bonus words that were found by everyone.
<p>
<img src=pics/bonus_list.png style="margin-left: .5in; width: 200px">
<p>
Which of these words do you know?  You can click on the words
to get definitions.
<p>
<img src=pics/micelle.png style="margin-left: .5in; width: 600px">
<p style="margin-bottom: 5mm">
While looking at the definitions you can choose <span class=blue>Search</span>
and then get images as noted above.
<p>
<img src=pics/micelle_img.png style="margin-top: 4mm; margin-left: .5in; width: 700px">
<p>
Close that window and then go Back in the browser to
return to where you were in the list of Bonus words.
<p>
Fun?  Educational?
It <i>is</i> a way to challenge and enlarge your vocabulary.

<h2>Your Accumulated Puzzles
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
If you continue to play and play and never remove your puzzles with the
above <span class=cmd>XA</span> command the puzzles will accumulate.
The <span class=cmd>L</span> command lists all of them.
Some people like to see the accumulation as it gives them 
a sense of abundance and accomplishment.  Others like to tidy up
from time to time and keep their space clear.
<p>
There is no guarantee that your accumulated puzzles
will not be lost (inadvertently oops) or tidied up for
you (to save disk space?).  If you would like to keep a permanent record
of the many puzzles you have played there is the
command <span class=cmd>DL</span> (for <span class=cmd>D</span>own<span class=cmd>L</span>oad).
It will generate downloadable comma-separated files of your puzzles and display, for example:
<ul>
80 puzzles, 8147 total words
<p>
Links to download your puzzle files:
<p>
<span style='margin-left: 1in' class=blue>List</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<span class=blue>Full</span>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>List</span> link will download a file
with 3 columns: date, rank, all pangrams.  The 'all pangrams' column is either
p or n – p means you that you found all of the pangrams;
n that you didn’t.
<p>
The <span class=blue>Full</span> link will download a file with
11 columns: date, letters, center, rank, all pangrams, number of hints,
puzzle, donut, lexicon, bonus, stash.
The last 5 columns contain the words you found
in each category.  The words are space separated.
This will give you everything that you could conceivably want, yes? &#128522;
<p>
The above 'date' column format is either yyyymmdd (for NYT puzzles)
or CP### (for community puzzles).
<p>
The downloaded files have a .csv suffix
and can be loaded into a spreadsheet.
Spreadsheet wizards can adjust the column formatting
to display the last 5 columns with narrower widths and wrapped text.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>DL</span> command will <i>not</i> remove the puzzles.
You can do that, if you wish, with the <span class=cmd>XA</span> command,
at your leisure.

<h2>Discussion Forum
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
We are social beings.  We like to share.
The HiveMind Forum of the New York Times is a very active community
of people who enjoy the challenge of the daily puzzle and
also enjoy discussing it.  Yes, it is full of complaints and bragging
but that’s okay! &#128522;  There is also a great deal of poetry
and clues and analysis and all kinds of clever literary fun.
<p>
UltraBee has a discussion forum as well.   It is
<u>built-in</u> to the software which makes it easy to use.
It is simple but sufficient.
The command <span class=cmd>F</span> toggles Forum Mode on and off.
You can also toggle it with the <span class=blue>Forum</span> link in the heading.
When it is <b>on</b> the screen looks like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/forum1.png width=650><p>
The word lists, status, and hint table are not shown.
Instead, there is a text area where you can share your
thoughts.  When you have finished composing your message
press the Submit button.   Your message will appear below
along with your <a href=#screen_names>screen name</a> and the time.
Messages are shown in reverse chronological order.
<p>
<img src=pics/forum2.png width=650>
<ul>
<li>Edit your own message by clicking the pencil icon <img src=pics/pencil.png width=20>.
<li>Delete your own message by clicking the trash can icon <img src=pics/trashcan.png width=20> and it will be removed after confirmation.
<li>If you see a message that you feel is inappropriate in some way you
can click the flag icon <img src=pics/flag.png width=20>. The flag will turn red <img src=pics/redflag.png width=20> and the authorities will be notified. &#128522;
</ul>

<li>http://hello.com becomes <a target=_blank href=http://hello.com>http://hello.com</a>
</ul>
If a puzzle has messages the number of messages will be shown 
<span class=red1>in red</span> at the top after the word Forum
like so:
<p>
<img src=pics/forum3.png width=550>
<p>
Messages are associated with the puzzle itself and persist.
The forum is a good place to give praise and thanks to
the creator of a <a href=#create>Community Puzzle</a>.
<p>
Remember that the <span class=cmd>F</span> command is a <u>toggle</u>.
After viewing the current messages and posting your own you
can toggle back to the normal display.  Even while you are in
Forum Mode you can still enter commands and any new words
that you have found.
<a name=colors></a>
<h2>Colors
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The <span class=cmd>CO</span> command controls the <span class=cmd>co</span>lors.
You can change the color of nearly everything you see.
Rather than being stuck with the standard NYT gray/gold hexagon:
<ul>
<img src=pics/hive.png width=180>
</ul>
and having it forever etched and <b>burned</b> into your retinas
you can have fun experimenting with different hues.
Perhaps your favorite color is <span style='color: skyblue'>sky blue</span>.
Or on Tuesdays you feel like a spicy <span style="color: pink">pink</span>/<span style="color: magenta">magenta</span>/<span style="color: red">red</span>.
Or on the weekends you want <span style="color: #777777">different</span> <span style="color: #999999">shades</span> <span style="color: aaaaaa">of</span> <span style="color: #dddddd">gray</span>.
<ul>
<img src=pics/blue.png width=170>
&nbsp;&nbsp
<img src=pics/spicy.png width=170>
&nbsp;&nbsp
<img src=pics/gray.png width=170>
</ul>
<h3>PreSet Colors</h3>
The simplest way to change the colors is with the 7 PreSets A to G:
<style>
.cc {
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
<ul>
<table cellpadding=10 border=1>
<tr><th>Command</td><th align=left>Name</th><th>Center Colors</th></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO A</td><td>NYT Standard</td>
<td class=cc style="background: gold; color: black;">A</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO B</td><td>The Blues</td>
<td class=cc style="background: cornflowerblue; color: midnightblue;">B</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO C</td><td>Floral</td>
<td class=cc style="background: firebrick; color: hotpink;">C</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO D</td><td style="background: black; color: white">Dark Mode</td>
<td class=cc style="background: gold; color: black;">D</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO E</td><td>Black and White</td>
<td class=cc style="background: rgb(204,204,204); color: rgb(178,178,178);">E</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO F</td><td>Lilac Spring</td>
<td class=cc style="background: teal; color: white;">F</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO G</td><td>Green Haze</td>
<td class=cc style="background: darkgreen; color: white;">G</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Each of these PreSets has a different mood and feel.
Try them all.  It’s okay to leave out the space - so COA, COB, COC, etc. will work.
<p>
These PreSets are nice but you will very likely want to tweak them
in various ways to create your own snazzy color scheme(s).
However you set and tweak the colors they will be remembered – they are
tied to your <a href=#identity>ID</a> so they will be preserved
from day to day and across browsers.
<h3>Precise Control of Colors</h3>
You have very fine control over the colors
but it is rather complex and takes a lot of explaining.
You can change the colors of 9 different areas:
<ol>
<li>The background of the center letter.
<li>The text of the center letter.
<li>The background of the donut letters (the 6 outer letters).
<li>The text of the donut letters.
<li>The background of the entire page.
<li>The text on the page (word lists, definitions, etc).
<li>The clickable links.
<li>The background of the command input field.
<li>The text in the command input field.
</ol>
<p>
<img src=pics/color.png style="width: 60%" border=1>
<p>
The <span class=cmd>CO</span> command by itself
will show a table of the current color settings:
<ul>
<style>
/* align td left just for the co table */
.co td {
    text-align: left;
}
</style>
<table cellpadding=3 class=co>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Center background</td><td>CORNFLOWERBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Center text</td></td><td>MIDNIGHTBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Donut background</td></td><td>LAVENDER</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Donut text</td></td><td>MEDIUMBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Page background</td></td><td>LIGHTBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Page text</td></td><td>RGB(102,102,102)</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Links</td></td><td>CORNFLOWERBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Input background</td></td><td>SKYBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Input text</td></td><td>DARKBLUE</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Here’s an example of how to change
the background (#1) and text (#2) of the center letter:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CO&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;RED&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;PINK</span>
</ul>
You give pairs – an area number (1-9) and a color for that area.
<p>
Colors can be expressed in 4 different ways:
<ol>
<li>The standard HTML color name - see this <a target=_blank href='https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp'>name reference</a>.  There are 140 different fun names - like <span style="color: orchid">Orchid</span> and
<span style="color: aquamarine">Aquamarine</span> &#128522.
<li>3 decimal rgb values (red-green-blue) - like this: rgb(45,140,210).  The rgb values are from 0 to 255.  
See this <a target=_blank href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_rgb.asp'>rgb reference</a>.  The red, green, and blue combine to make more than 16 million different colors (256*256*256 = 16,777,216).
<li>6 hexadecimal digits - like this: #04FA99. The 3 hex digit pairs
represent the values of red, green, and blue - from 00 to FF (instead of 0 to 255).
See this <a target=_blank href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_hex.asp'>hex reference</a>.
<li>Shades of gray - G1 (nearly black) to G9 (whitish).
</ol>
The 3 references above have color mixers and color pickers that are
fun to play with.  You can find a color you like and then
select-copy-paste the rgb or hex color values.
<p>
Here’s another command
to change the page background (#5) and link (#7) colors:
<p>
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CO&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;LAVENDER&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;#B21F1F</span>
</ul>
And the input text (#9) and the page text (#6):
<p>
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CO&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;G4&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;RGB(200,120,190)</span>
</ul>
<a name=schemes></a>
<h3>Color Schemes</h3>
You may want to have a <i>collection</i>
of several favorite color combinations (aka Color Schemes).
Perhaps one for weekday mornings and another for late night.
Once you have configured a set of colors you really like
you should save it by name with the <span class=cmd>SCO</span> command:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SCO&nbsp;LATE</span>
</ul>
Your color scheme name cannot be one of the standard HTML Color Names nor
can it be a single letter as they are reserved for the PreSets.
<p>
<span class=cmd>CO</span> is used to put one of your color schemes in place:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CO&nbsp;&nbsp;MORN</span>
</ul>
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>LCO</span> will list your color schemes.
They can be deleted with <span class=cmd>XCO</span>:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>XCO&nbsp;&nbsp;PURP</span>
</ul>
Note that 16 million different colors in 9 different areas
create more than 10<sup>65</sup> possible combinations!  That’s plenty
of room for self expression.  See the <a href=#calc><sup class=red>††</sup></a> footnote for the fun calculation.

<h2>Clues for Puzzles
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Getting dictionary definitions for words with the
<span class=cmd>D</span> command
is nice – even though some people would consider it “cheating” &#128521;.
Even more fun is to look at <b>clues</b> generously provided by
members of the HiveMind.  These clues are often humorous and clever
wordplay - as in crossword puzzle clues.  The word “clue” is used here
instead of “hint”.  These clues are much more creative and entertaining than
formal dictionary definitions or revealed letters.
<p>
You can write clues when you create a Community Puzzle as seen <a href=#create>below</a>.
You can <i>also</i> create clues for NYT Puzzles.
To make clues for today’s NYT puzzle there is this link:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee href='https://ultrabee.org/mkclues'>ultrabee.org/mkclues</a>
</ul>
Spoiler warning: This link will reveal <i>all</i> of the words.
<ul>
<li>Creating clues requires you to have a
<a href='#screen_names'>Screen Name and Identity String</a>.
<li>You don’t need to give clues for every word.
<li>You can get dictionary definitions of the words to give
you some ideas.  Clicking on the words will give a brief definition.
Click on the brief definition to see the <i>complete</i> definition in another window.
<li>If you have given clues for a word before (such as for
frequently occuring words
like LOLL, NOON or TOOT) your clues will be offered and you can
cycle through them.
<li>If you want a multi-line clue put &lt;br&gt; at the end of lines.
<li>On Apple’s OSX emojis can be inserted into clues with control-command-space.
</ul>
When you have finished with your clues they are all presented in a nice format.
In fact, there are 6 <i>different</i> nice formats in which to see your clues.
Choose your preferred format and then click on “Ok”.  This will do two things:
<ol>
<li>Clear the format choices.
<li>Copy the clues onto the system clipboard.
</ol>
Then, if you wish, you can Paste your clues into the NYT HiveMind Forum.
In this way your clues can benefit those
people who are playing Spelling Bee with the NYT app or
the standard NYT web application.
<p>
Clues are shown when you use the <span class=cmd>D</span> command.
If there are clues from multiple authors they will be color-coded.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>I</span> (information) command will show the
names of people who submitted clues.
Clicking on an author’s name will show the complete list of their clues.
Note that in this display,
if you’ve already found a word, that word is appended to the clue
and the whole line is in gray rather than black.  This helps you
focus on the clues for the words you have not yet found.
The tradition in the HiveMind Forum is that clues come in
the word alphabetical order and <i>can</i> have the length shown as well.
If you know this you have more information beyond the clue itself.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>CL</span> command will list the dates
of the NYT puzzles for which you have created clues. 
<p>
If you leave all of the clue fields blank
your clue offering is effectively deleted.

<h2>Creating a Community Puzzle
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Why should Sam Ezersky be the only one to have the fun
(and responsibility) of puzzle creation?
<b>You</b> can create your <i>own</i> puzzle to share with the
HiveMind community.  To do so just click on this link:
<a target=nytbee4 href='https://ultrabee.org/mkpuz.html'>Create Puzzle</a>.
<p>
There are 5 steps to create a puzzle:
<style>
li {
    margin-bottom: 3mm;
}
</style>
<ol>
<li>Choose a “pangramic” word - a word with exactly 7 unique characters.
This ensures that there will be at least one pangram in your puzzle.
In the NYT puzzles the letter S does not occur at all but
here you <i>are</i> allowed to have an S in your word.
You can also use E and R in the same puzzle, if you wish.
<p>
How to find a pangramic word?  There are five different ways:
<ol style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'>
<li>On the page you will see links to 3 long
lists of pangramic words to choose from:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Pangrams from NYT Puzzles
<li>Pangramic words from a list of 10,000 common English words
<li>Pangramic words from the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>
</ol>
These lists are disjoint.
<li>It is overwhelming to be confronted with such a large number
of word choices.  It’s nice to be offered a smaller number.
On the page you’ll see an <span class=rand>R5</span>
after the above 3 lists. They are links.
Clicking on them will show you 5 random pangramic words from that file.
Pressing Return will give you 5 more.
<li>If you have a word that you want to appear in the puzzle
you can search for pangramic words whose resulting puzzle
could have that word as part of the solution.    There is a second
text field for this purpose.
<p>
For example, the word “<span style="color: purple">enigma</span>” yields
“<span class=green>magazine</span>” from the NYT puzzles, “<span class=green>demanding examining messaging remaining</span>”
from the 10,000 word list, and 54 (!) words from the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a> - most
of which are too esoteric for a “reasonable” puzzle.
However &#128522; ... among those 54 I do see these that are quite reasonable:
<ul class=green>
<li>beaming
<li>egomania
<li>imagines
<li>maddening
<li>margarine
<li>menacing
<li>menagerie
<li>migraine
<li>mismanage
</ul>
<li>You can simply enter 7 unique letters and and see if there are any words in the lists that use those 7.  Try, for example, <span class=green>abclrne</span>.
<li>Let’s say you have a friend named Bob Smith.  Notice that there are
exactly 7 unique letters in his name.  There are no pangramic words
in any of the above lists that use the letters 
<span class=green>bhimost</span> but we
can still proceed with making a puzzle for Bob.  Enter bobsmith
as the pangramic word and choose a center letter.
The “word” <span class=green>Bobsmith</span>
will be added to the “Other qualified” words and I’m sure you can
come up with a clever clue for Bobsmith that will make Bob Smith smile &#128522;.
</ol>
<li>Given your pangramic word, tallies are done of words, scores, 4 letter words, and pangrams by center letter.
Analyze these and choose a center letter.
<li>Choose which words to include in your puzzle.  This is the most
difficult part.  If you <i>don’t</i> include a common word or <i>do</i>
include a very rare or esoteric word you may be subject
to questioning and possible derision. &#128521;
Surprisingly, there are many common ordinary words that have not yet been used
in any NYT Puzzle.
You do not need to include <i>all</i> common ordinary words.
This is your own custom personalized puzzle and you can make your own rules!
<li>Give clues for the words, if you wish.  See the <a href=#clues>previous section</a> for
more details on entering the clues.
Note that it is a nice gesture to add clues for your puzzle. The clues are a gift to
the people playing your puzzle and another opportunity for you to be clever &#128522;.
It also increases the chance that your puzzle will be included in the
puzzles recommended with
the <span class=cmd>RCP</span> command.
<li>Final steps:
<p>
<ol style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'>
<li>Your name and location.
<li>A title and description for your puzzle (optional).
<li>Is the puzzle is ready
to be “published” and available to the community?
</ol>
Note that the description is subject to the same formatting as
<a href=#forum>Forum</a> posts.  e.g. *hello* becomes <b>hello</b>.
</ol>
When these steps are complete your puzzle is assigned
a number and is immediately available to the community.
This number is used when giving the <span class=cmd>CP##</span> command.
CP here stands for Community Puzzle - a puzzle created by you for the HiveMind community!
<p>
A link will be displayed that looks like this:
<ul>
<span style="color: blue">https://ultrabee.org/cgi-bin/nytbee.pl/CP##</span>
</ul>
where ## is your puzzle number.  This link can be shared.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>LCP</span> command lists the community puzzles.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>RCP</span> command lists puzzles that I <span class=cmd>r</span>ecommend because I find them interesting, clever, or an unusual challenge.
Puzzles with clues are more likely to be included.
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>YCP</span> will list the community puzzles
that you have created.  You can click on the <span class=blue>CP##</span> link
to re-edit your puzzle.  You can update/change/delete the words and clues - but not the 7 letters or center letter.
You can also change the title and description.
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>XCP&lt;num&gt;</span> can be used to <i>delete</i> puzzles
that <i>you</i> have created.
<p>
The description of your puzzle can be used to inform
people why you made the puzzle and explain any guidelines for
what words might be included or excluded.

Since the letters in words occur in a line the Inline presentation
(instead of the hexagonal) is somehow more natural.
Repeated random shuffling of the inline letters can sometimes

This command also allows you to replicate your identity from one browser to another (e.g. Safari to Chrome or desktop browser to mobile browser).
<p>
The long string is computer generated and is guaranteed to be unique - but it
is long!  
A much easier way to establish your identity is to create a string

example:
<ul>
    <span class=cmd>ID</span> <span class=green>GERTIE4/30</span>

<h2>Other NYT Bee Projects
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The NY Times Spelling Bee concept has been a fertile source of challenge for
many clever software engineers.
<p>
<h3>Games You Can Play</h3>
<a target=nytbee href='https://quordle-wordle.com/spelling-bee'>https://quordle-wordle.com/spelling-bee</a> This site took all of the NYT puzzles and lets you play one of them at random.  You can’t choose one by date.  No Hint Table or Two Letter List.  The list of found words is vertical which is less than helpful.
There are some annoying ads.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://contrabee.com'>Contra Bee</a> 
A love note to spelling bee.  This site takes the daily NYT Bee and asks you to
enter Donut words.  It has an “official” list of Donut words and you try
to get to Genius rank by finding all the words in the list.  You can play
yesterday’s puzzle as well.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://bee.ignoble.dev'>bee.ignoble.dev {} Bee</a> 
- Generates a daily puzzle (not NYT) from the <a target=_blank href='http://aspell.net'>English Aspell Dictionary</a>.  There are puzzles going back to
5/17/2020.  Puzzles on Sunday have fewer than 41 words.  The number of
words increases through the week until Friday puzzles have more than
120 words.  Saturday puzzles have more than 120 words excluding the letters s and d.
Can sort the found words in 3 ways.
It has a “spoiler” mechanism to reveal all words.
I found a bug in the scoring: Some 4 letter words score more than 4!??
(This is because he scores words according to the Scrabble value of each letter instead of the NYT Bee scoring method.)
It keeps a tally of how many words of each length you need and have found.
A very clean interface.  With no advertisements or requests for donations.
&#128077;
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://swilliams.io/fun/hex/'>swilliams.io.fun/hex</a>
- A Javascript implementation.  Fast.  Clean code.
Uses a file of 1,500 pangramic words and a file of 10,000
common words.  A different puzzle each day.  No ranks.
No hint table.  Not NYT Puzzles so not “curated”.  
Github repo is <a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/s-williams/Hexgame'>here</a>.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://freebee.fun'>freebee.fun</a>
is a free web version of the game that you can play!
Javascript and HTML/CSS.
It doesn’t use NYT words so the word list is not “curated”.
There is no hint table.
Source code in C is available for a command line version.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/philshem/open-spelling-bee'>Philip Shemella</a>
A command line game you can play written in Python.
Again, doesn’t use NYT words.  It also generates new games.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://seanrayment.me/projects/nytimes-spelling-bee-clone/'>Cloning the NYT Bee</a> Written in node.js and other modern tools.  Only two games to play.  No hint table.  Choose “live demo” at the bottom.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://bumblewords.com'>bumblewords.com</a> A Javascript game.  Clean.  Not NYT Puzzles.  Cannot type - must click/tap.  It has a leaderboard.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qIxYZtqbw'>A sequence of 7 videos</a> The functionality of the NYT Spelling Bee is (sort of) replicated in Javascript/HTML/CSS.  The entire process is explained in great (<i>excruciating</i>) detail.
<h3>A Dynamic Hints Table</h3>
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/upshot/spelling-bee-buddy.html'>Spelling Bee Buddy</a> A valiant effort by a group of engineers and designers (Upshot?) to make a dynamic grid and two letter list.  There is some magic that connects the NYT puzzle to their site - on a per person basis.  They also try to provide hints/clues from people in the HiveMind that have offered a list of clues.  Pretty nice but awkward - the dynamic hint table is in another window.  What kind of communication do they use between the windows?
This same group produced the WordleBot.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://worker-bee.io'>worker-bee.io</a> No longer active. This was a dynamic Hint Table in Javascript - pretty but somewhat
fragile as it didn’t have the full word list.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://beesquared.ga'>beesquared.ga</a> Yet another dynamic Hint Table in Javascript similar to worker-bee.io.
<p>
<a target=_blank href='https://spellingbee.tips/hints'>Spelling Bee Tips</a> Clues and definitions and incremental revealing.  Can paste words from NYT puzzle.  Pretty fancy but awkward to use.  Where do the clues and definitions come from?
<p>
<a target=_blank href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honeycomb-hints/id6446508329'>Honeycomb Hints</a> An iOS app.  You upload a screenshot of your found words and the app extracts them and updates the Hint Table.  How are the words deduced from the image?  OCR?  Impressive - but troublesome to use.  It doesn’t verify the words are in the "allowed list" or are even qualified.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://spelling-bee-assistant.app/'>Spelling Bee Assistant</a> An extension for the Chrome browser that interacts with the NY Times Spelling Bee site.  Provides dynamic counts.  No hints or definitions.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='http://ljkrakauer.com/LJK/20s/spellingbee.htm'>Excel Spreadsheet for the Hints Table</a> This updates the hint table as words are found and pasted in.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.thegamebureau.com/beesheet'>Spelling Bee Hint Worksheet</a> A kind of spreadsheet you print out and, with a pen or pencil, fill in the words you have found.  This is further proof that there is an unmet need for the grid to be dynamic.

<h3>NY Times Puzzle Answers</h3>
The 9 sites below show the list of allowed words in the
NY Times puzzle for each day.  In a variety of formats.
The intention is to help people solve the puzzle or, more accurately,
see what words they missed.  Most have annoying ads. &#128542;
<ol>
<li><a target=nytbee href='https://wordpuzzlepro.com'>wordpuzzlepro.com</a>
The best of the 9. Beautiful graphics and design.
A full archive going back to the beginning.

Clever historical analysis of words.
An entertaining FAQ.
The ads are very annoying!
<li><a target=nytbee href='https://hejhej.dev/bee'>hejhej.dev/bee</a>

<li><a target=nytbee href='https://spellingbeeanswers.com'>spellingbeeanswers.com</a> Pretty formatting but not much else.
<li><a target=nytbee href='https://nytspellingbeeanswers.org'>nytspellinganswers.org</a> Fancy narrative formatting.
<li><a target=nytbee href='https://spellingbeetimes.com'>spellingbeetimes.com</a>
They have definitions – grabbed from somewhere – but not one for BIKING on 11/26/21?  They even generate a silly youtube video!
<li><a target=nytbee href='https://the-frenemy.com/nyt-spelling-bee-answers-daily/'>the-frenemy.com</a> Other word puzzles as well.
<li><a target=nytbee href='https://walkthroughs.net/nyt-spelling-bee-jan-28-2022-answers/'>walkthroughs.net</a> Just the answers.  It started on 1/28/22.  May not always be there!  Who knows why?  The url contains the date - which you will need to modify. &#128579;
</ol>
<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<ol>
<li><a target=nytbee href='https://beebox.ghost.io'>The Completely Unauthorized NYT Spelling Bee Toolbox</a> This site was the inspiration for the Jumble Table.
Beautifully formatted.  Clicking on a jumbled word will reveal the word itself.
<li><a target=nytbee href='https://buymenyt.com'>SpellKing (aka buymenyt.com)</a> This site was the inspiration for Super Bonus Words.  The 7 letters in these puzzles do not track the NYT daily puzzle.  They do not allow an S as an additional letter.  I guess the domain name of buymeny (Buy Me NYT) was chosen to suggest that the NY Times purchase his software just like they did with Wordle.

<h3>NY Times Engineering Director</h3>

<h2>Without a Subscription?
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Is it illegal or unethical to play the NYT Spelling Bee puzzles without a subscription?
<p>
I <b>do</b> have a <a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/subscription'>subscription</a> to the Times.  It is a reliable,
trusted, and curated source of information in these troubled times.
<a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/subscription'>Subscriptions</a>
help the many journalists stay focused on their story.
<p>
<a name=html></a>
When the puzzle page is loaded into the web browser
the list of allowed words
<i>is</i> visible – if you know where to look.
This is what you will see in the HTML/Javascript page source:
<pre>
window.gameData = {
    "today": {
    "expiration": 1638345600,
    "displayWeekday": "Tuesday",
    "displayDate": "November 30, 2021",
    "printDate": "2021/11/30",
    "centerLetter": "h",
    "outerLetters": ["d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "validLetters": ["h", "d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "pangrams": ["goodnight", "hotdogging"],
    "answers": ["goodnight", "hotdogging", "dhoti", "doth",
        "godhood", "goth", "hiding", "high", "hind",
        "hinging", "hint", "hinting", "hitting", "hogging",
        "honing", "hood", "hooding", "hoodoo", "hoot",
        "hooting", "hotdog", "nigh", "night", "ninth",
        "nothing", "thigh", "thin", "thing", "thinning",
        "thong", "tight", "tithing", "tonight", "tooth"],
...
</pre>
So the words in the puzzle <i>are</i> available publicly each day.
The new mechanism I created is simply an alternate way
of using these words.

<h2>Same 7 Letters
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
In the large NYT Spelling Bee <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a> there are many puzzles that share the
same set of 7 letters and hence the same pangrams.   
For example, there are 3 that
have occurred on 5 different dates:
<ul>

The <span class=cmd>F7</span> command finds other dates that use the
same 7 letters as in the current puzzle.
These other puzzles usually (but not always)
have a different center letter.
Note these identical puzzles: 08/03/19 and 08/24/20.
<p>
<span class=cmd>F7</span> will also show what percentage of words
in the other puzzles are the same as in the current puzzle.
<p>
I’m curious why the NY Times has to keep RE-using / recycling
the same pangramic words.
There are SO many other choices.  If you feel the same 
you can <a target=_blank href='https://ultrabee.org/mkpuz.html'>
create your own puzzle</a> with
a different colorful intriguing pangram!
It could even include an S (OMG!) or have both an E and an R!

<h2>NYT Archival Puzzles
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The archive was gathered mostly from
<a target=nytbee href=https://nytbee.com>nytbee.com</a>.
It is now added to daily at 3:00 a.m. EST by extracting the words
from the New York Times site.  There are daily puzzles going all the way
back to May 9, 2018.   There are now
<!-- Do NOT mess with the next two lines - see cgi-bin/nytbee_list.pl! -->
2561 puzzles with
a total of 10654 different words!
<p>
Tallies are made of the many puzzles and words.
See this table of the puzzles:
<p class=ind>
<a target=_blank href='list/puzzle-date-asc.html'>NYT Spelling Bee Puzzles</a>
<p>
You will see date, 
center letter, # words, # pangrams, score, # four letter words, and bingo.
You can sort the table ascending or descending on all these things.
<p>
And see this table of the words:
<p class=ind>
<a target=_blank href='list/word-word-asc.html'>Words in the NYT Spelling Bee</a>
<p>
You will see word, length, frequency, and date the word first appeared.
You can sort the table ascending or descending on all these things.
<p>
If you scroll down on these pages you will see a link to
<span style="color: red">Load the entire file</span>.
This was done to make for faster loading of the top of the file
(which is likely what you are most interested in).
<p>
Which puzzles from the large archive to play?
You can get one at random with the <span class=cmd>NR</span> command or you could
choose one with various attributes like ones with the most points or the
fewest 4 letter words.
<p>
Starting an archival puzzle is simple.
Just enter the puzzle date (like 12/16/21)
in the text field where you would enter a word.
<p>
To facilitate your curiousity and research
you can see <a target=_blank href=list/nyt_puzzles.txt>this text file</a>
of the many puzzles.  The lines have this format:
<p>
<pre class=ind>
yyyymmdd => seven center pangrams ... | words ...
</pre>
For example:
<p>
<pre class=ind>
20180524 => abceklm k camelback clambake | aback alack ... meek
</pre>

Another way to do Bee “research” is to search NYT Bee words
and <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a> words for a pattern with this site:

<h2>The Many Ways to “Cheat”
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
There are many ways to play this silly game. Aside from the normal puzzle there
are many <a href=#games>games within the game</a>.
<p>
Most
people play by trying to find all the words in the
puzzle’s “allowed list” ALL BY THEMSELVES – using no
other source than their own mind and memory.
This is admirable.  But we are not all so dedicated or pure nor do we have
the time it takes!
This is what the <a href=#hint_commands>hints and clues and definitions</a>
are for – to give us a bit of help.  
You <i>are</i> charged for this assistance by the accumulation of
“hint points”.
With this help we can get to Genius or Queen Bee.  This kind of help is not
really <i>cheating</i>.
<p>
Another <i>minor</i> cheat is to ask Google how to spell a word.  Google is
very good at taking a misspelling and showing how it should be spelled.
You came up with the word! You simply weren’t sure how to spell it!
See <a href=#misspellings>this section</a> for an easy way to ask Google.
<p>
It you <i>DO</i> want to cheat using more sneaky means there are many ways:
<ol>
<li>You can consult the <a href=#answers>many web sites</a> that
reveal the entire list of allowed words.
<li>You can use a different <span class=cmd>ID</span>, play the game, and use the <span class=cmd>G Y</span> command
to reveal the words.  Select and copy them, switch back to your own <span class=cmd>ID</span>,
and paste the words.
<li>Use the <span class=cmd>I</span> command which shows the people who have created a set
of clues (e.g. Kitt Richards).  Clicking on their name will show
all of their clues and not charge you any hint points.
You can also consult the HiveMind forum on the NYT site (there’s a HiveMind link in the <span class=cmd>I</span> command output). 
Many people offer clues there.
<li>The NYT site offers the Hint Table and Two Letter List which
you can consult without being charged any hints.  These resources
are not normally dynamic (as in UltraBee – with the
<span class=cmd>HT</span> and <span class=cmd>TL</span> commands) 
but there IS the Spelling Bee Buddy
which (through some clever magic) makes them dynamic –
updating as you find words.
<li>If you bring up the Bee on the NYT website and you
know how to see the <a href=#html>HTML/Javascript source</a> of the page you can
see the list of words – without any hint points charged.
<li>Use the <span class=cmd>F7</span> command to see if there
are other puzzles that use the same 7 letters.  There is usually
a different center letter in these puzzles but many of the words in their
allowed list might also be words (or Donut words) in the current puzzle.
The pangrams will certainly be the same.
You can use the <span class=cmd>G YP</span> command to reveal the words
in these other puzzles
and then copy-paste them into the current puzzle – without being
charged any hint points.
<li>If you are literate with <a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression'>regular expressions</a> you can enter this on OSX
in the Terminal application:
<p>
<pre>
    % egrep '^[abcdef<span class=red>g</span>]{4,}$' /usr/share/dict/words | grep <span class=red>g</span>
</pre>
abcdefg above should be replaced by the seven letters in the
puzzle.  Note that g is the center letter.
<p>
The above command will show all qualifying puzzle words that occur
in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>. 
Not all will be in the allowed list as there
are many rare and obscure words in that lexicon.
<li>Related to the above cheat (and easier to access)
is to use the 
<a href='https://ultrabee.org/cgi-bin/regexp.pl'>Bee Word Search</a>
as described in the prior section.
You enter the same regular expression ( ^[abcdefg]{4,}$ ) and
choose whether to search the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a> or the words
in the NYT Spelling Bees.  You then use control-F
to search for the center letter (g) in the resulting
list of words within the browser window.
<li>One way to NOT effectively cheat is to ask chatGPT to help you.
It is remarkably stupid at this task no matter how cleverly you ask it.
<li>Another way to NOT cheat is to use the command <span class=cmd>C YA</span> to clear the game and start over.  Overall hint totals are not cleared with that command!
<li>There are probably other ways to cheat.  <script>abcd('Let me know')</script> and I’ll add
to this list. &#128522;
</ol>
The <span class=cmd>TOP</span> command shows who has
achieved the various ranks.  It also shows how many hints were needed.
If you decide to “cheat” so that your hint count remains at zero
<i>you know</i> what you have done.  There <i>is</i> a certain illicit pleasure
in this but it is not for everyone.
<p>
<h3>Donut and Bonus Words</h3>
It is not so easy to cheat with Donut and Bonus words because
there is no “official” list.  This is part of their charm.
<p>
Here is one way to cheat with Donut words (in the OSX Terminal with regular expressions):
<pre>
    % egrep '^[abcdef]{4,}$' /usr/share/dict/words
</pre>
where abcdef are the 6 donut letters.
<p>
Here is one way to cheat with Bonus words (in the OSX Terminal with regular expressions):
<pre>
    % egrep '^[abcdefg<span class=red>j</span>]{6,}$' /usr/share/dict/words | grep <span class=red>j</span>
</pre>
The above will find Bonus words with an additional letter J.

<h2>Known Issues
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
This software is made by one person, not a team of NYT engineers.
It has limitations and weaknesses.  Here are the known issues:
<ul>
<li>The software was not designed for high volume.
If the usage becomes high the response time would suffer.
The software would need to be redesigned and possibly rewritten.
<li>Since you do not need to register and login (which is nice), your identity
is preserved in a “cookie” (aka website data)
within your web browser.  As long as you
don’t “clear your cookies” you will be fine.  Your identity within the program
is only truly important if you have added clues or created a community puzzle.
You can play the game regardless.
<p>
All browsers have a way
to clear the history <i>without</i> removing the website data.  For example,
on Safari holding the Option (aka Alt) key while clearing the history will
Keep Website Data.
<p>
Note that the <span class=cmd>ID</span> <a href=#power_id>Power User</a> command
is a way to restore your identity yourself.
<li>If two people using the same computer
want to play today’s puzzle separately they
can use two different browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc) OR
simply reset the game with the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command.
They could also each reset their identity with the <span class=cmd>ID</span>
<a href=#power_id>Power User</a> command.
<li>There is some issue with copying to the clipboard on the
Safari browser.
<li>Finally, I know there are many unknown issues.  If you find them
please <script>abcd('let me know');</script>.

It only takes I, K, and N in a puzzle for 4 of these to qualify.
And an additional C permits 10 more!
They may not be in the “allowed list” but <i>would</i> be accepted as Lexicon words.  If you’re looking for Bonus words there are many possibilities. &#128522; 
<p>
While the words KINK, WINK, KNIT, and CLINK have appeared in many puzzles (use the Power User command 'S KINK') KINNIKINNIK has not yet appeared. &#128542;
