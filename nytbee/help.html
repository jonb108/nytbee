<h2>Introduction</h2>
The New York Times has had the Spelling Bee
puzzle in the print version of the weekly New York Times Magazine since 2014.
The daily <a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>
web version</a> launched on May 9, 2018.
Wikipedia has links to several <a target=nytbee href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Spelling_Bee'>stories about the game</a>
and the vibrant community of people who enjoy it (the &#8220;HiveMind&#8221;).
Many people play the game on their phone with the New York Times app.
<p>
Here is the NY Times version:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee1 href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee</a>
</ul>
Now thereâ€™s <i>another</i> way to play:

</ul>
This new enhanced alternate mechanism has several 
<a href=#advantages>advantages</a>.
<p>
There are several <a href=#videos>videos</a> to show how it works.
<p>
Give it a try and <script>abcd('let me know');</script> what you think.

My name is Jon Bjornstad.  I live in Davis, CA.  I am 74 years old.
I retired from the corporate software world a few years ago
but I still very much enjoy the art of programming.
In short, I am an old Perl hacker.
When I saw the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a> of the NYT Spelling Bee
and realized that it was <i>static</i>, that it did not change as
you found words, I immediately thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s not right.  I can do better.&#8221;
And I have.  The complete source code for this project is on

<h2>How to Play
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<ul style='margin-top: 8px'>
<img height=270 src=pics/df_honeycomb.png>
<li>Create words using the 7 letters.
<li>Words must contain at least 4 letters.
<li>Words must include the center letter.
<li>Letters can be used more than once.
<p>
<li>The list of allowed words does not include words
that are obscure, hyphenated, or proper nouns.
<li>No cussing either, sorry.
<p>
<li>Score points to increase your rating.
<li>4-letter words are worth 1 point each.
<li>Longer words earn 1 point per letter.
<li>Each puzzle includes at least one &#8220;pangram&#8221; which uses every letter. These are worth 7 extra points!
</ul>
The &#8220;allowed list&#8221; is a finite list of words chosen by
the puzzle creator.  Your challenge is to find them all.
<p>
Finding <b>all</b> of the words is just one way to play.
There are other '<a href=#games>games within the game</a>' that are another
kind of fun challenge.
<a name=advantages></a>
<h2>Advantages

</ul>
<a name=words></a>
<h2>Words and Commands
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The new mechanism looks like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/new_look.png width=600>
<p>
In the text field you enter words that satisfy the rules of the puzzle.
You can enter more than one word.  Press Return to see if the words are
acceptable.  Any error messages will appear above the text field.
Words you have found will appear below the text field in alphabetical order.
<p>
Pressing Return when the text field is empty will clear any messages.
If there are no messages to clear, the 6 outer letters will be permuted.
<p>
If you lose focus on the text field you can restore it by
hitting the Tab key.
<p>
<p>
At the top the <span class=blue>Help</span> link shows this document.
The <a target=_blank href=cmds.html>Cmds</a> link shows the <a target=_blank href=cmds.html>list of commands</a> you can enter in the text field.
Here are a few simple ones:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>I</span></td><td>Show <span class=cmd>I</span>nformation about the puzzle including numbers of words, points, pangrams, and (maybe) <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a>.
Note that a pangram is termed &#8220;perfect&#8221; if it is 7 letters long.
<p>If the puzzle was <a href=#create>created</a> by the HiveMind community details from the creator are given.
<p>
If <a href=#clues>clues have been added</a> for a puzzle the authors are listed.  Click on an author name to see <i>all</i> of their clues.  There are 6 different formats you can choose from.  
<p>
There is also the word <span class="color: blue">HiveMind</span> which is a link to the forum of the NY Times.  Click on it to see the extended yet entertaining discussion about the puzzle.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>R</span></td><td>Show the <span class=cmd>r</span>ankings - from Beginner to ... Amazing to Genius to Queen Bee.  It also shows how many points are needed to get to the next rank.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>W</span></td><td>Show the found words in the order they were found.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>SC</span></td><td>Show how the score was tallied and how many words remain to be found.  A thin line shows where you first asked for a hint.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>M</span></td><td>Show the latest Message of the Day.  These messages will be shown periodically to give tips, tricks, and other information.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TOP</span></td><td>
Show the <a href=#screen_names>screen names</a> of people who have achieved
the ranks of Queen Bee down to Good Start for <i>today's</i> puzzle.
Also shown are the number of <a href=#hint>hints</a> they needed.
If someone achieved <a href=#gn4l>GN4L or GOTN</a> this is noted.
<a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> achievements are shown for
<a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> puzzles.
<p>
There is a link &#8220;Share your score.&#8221; Clicking on it will copy
a description of your scores to the clipboard.
You can paste it into a text message or email
to share your score with your friends.
It looks like this:

<h2>Screen Names and Your Identity
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
There is no need to register or login to this game.  This is nice.
ALL are welcome.
It is helpful, however, to have <i>some</i> form of identification.
To address this need there are <b>screen names</b> and an
<b>identity</b> string - both of which are initially assigned to you.
The screen name is your unique <i>public</i>-facing name.
The identity string is <i>private</i>, secret, and unique.
<h3>Screen Name</h3>
For fun, the randomly assigned screen name is composed of
one of these Bee related words:
<ul>
Hive Bee Queen Worker Drone Honey Bumble Apian Buzz
</ul>
plus a number. Like Queen3 or Buzz45.
<p>
Screen names are shown with the 
<span class=cmd>CW</span>
command which
shows the fun <a href=#competition>competition</a> for Extra Words.
They are also used when you post a message to the <a href=#forum>Forum</a>.
<p>
You can change your screen name at any time
with the command <span class=cmd>SN</span> like
so:
<ul>
SN CHARLIE
</ul>
<b>However</b>, <i>before</i> changing your screen name, you should
use the ID command (see below) to set your identity string.
<p>
The screen name can be almost <i>anything</i> you wish.  The only
restriction is that it cannot contain the characters &lt;, &gt;, or space.
Uniqueness is enforced.
The name is entered in ALL CAPS but is transformed like so:
<ul>
BEE_THE_ONE
</ul>
becomes:
<ul>
BeeTheOne
</ul>
The first letter is capitalized as are the letters after an underscore.
The other letters are in lower case.
<p>
Entering the <span class=cmd>SN</span> command by itself will show you
what your screen name is.
<a name=identity></a>
<h3>Identity String</h3>
The identity string is generated to be unique.  It is a long string
of characters like this:
<div class=long_string>963e4401-81eq-18ec-g81c-b1f85c942ex3<span></div>
<p>
This string is saved in your web browser data (aka cookies) so that if you
leave and return later your words and games are remembered.  Nice.
<p>
The unfortunate issue with this mechanism is that if you:
<ul>
<li>clear your web data and browser history,
<li>use a different browser, or
<li>use incognito/private pages
</ul>
a <i>new</i> identity string will be generated for you - and you will not see
your words and games. &#128542;
<p>
A better way to establish your identity is to create a string
that you know is (very likely) unique to you
(like your name plus your birthdate) and enter it with the <span class=cmd>ID</span> command. For
example:
<ul>
    <span class=cmd>ID</span> <span class=green>GERTIE4/30</span>
</ul>
Now if your web data and browser history is cleared
or you use a different browser
you can easily re-establish your identity by <b>RE</b>-entering the above command.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>ID</span> command can be used if you mostly
play on your computer with a keyboard but also want to play on
your mobile phone when you are out and about.
Enter your <span class=cmd>ID</span>
command in both places and you will see your words and games in
both places.  Nice!
<p>
Entering the <span class=cmd>ID</span> command by itself will show you
what your identity string is.
<a name=mobile></a>
<h2>Playing on a Mobile Phone or Tablet
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
While it is easiest to play on a computer with a keyboard
it is <i>also</i> easy to play on a mobile phone or tablet.
I have an iPhone and
using the Safari browser with the text enlarged
(with the <span style="font-size: 12pt">A</span>A icon) to 150%
and holding the phone horizontally, 
this is what the screen looks like:
<p>
<img src=pics/nytbee_iPhone.png width=800 border=1>
<p>
In this mobile mode the heading has been toggled off.
There are 9 command links to the right of the hexagon letters:
<span class=cmd>Stash</span>,
<span class=cmd>Define</span>,
<span class=cmd>Donut</span>,
<span class=cmd>Enter</span>,
<span class=cmd>Delete</span>,
<span class=cmd>Bonus</span>,
<span class=cmd>Top</span>,
<span class=cmd>Help</span>,
and <span class=cmd>Forum</span>.
<p>
Tapping on letters will copy them to the area on the right:
<p>
<img src=pics/laundry.png width=800 border=1>
<p>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Stash</span> to add the word to <a href=#stash>The Stash</a>.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Define</span> to do a <span class=cmd>DR</span> command to define a random unfound word.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Donut</span> to switch into <a href=#donut>Donut Mode</a>.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Enter</span> to submit the word.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Delete</span> to remove letters.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Bonus</span> to switch into <a href=#bonus_mode>Bonus Mode</a>.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Top</span> to issue the <span class=cmd>TOP</span> command.
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Help</span> to bring up this document in a separate browser window.  
<br>
Tap on <span class=cmd>Forum</span> to toggle <a href=#forum>Forum Mode</a>.
<p>
If you wish to enter a command, see the list of found words,
or view the Hint Table simply scroll down.
<p>
Android phones will behave in a similar way.
<p>
If you are playing on an iPad or Tablet with a touch screen
you can use the <span class=cmd>MO</span> command to toggle into "mobile mode".
<p>
If you are adept at texting with your thumbs you may prefer using the <span class=cmd>H</span> command to toggle between the hexagon and having the letters arranged in a line (as in normal words) - like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/laundry_h.png width=800 border=1>
<a name=hint_commands></a>
<h2>Hint Commands
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
It is <i>not</i> easy to find <i>all</i> the words in a puzzle
and reach the stratospheric height of the Queen Bee rank.
Most of us mere mortals need some kind of help to get to Amazing or Genius.

Note that if there are no 4 letter words in the found list the <span class=cmd>DR</span> command will do a <span class=cmd>D5</span> to only include 5+ letter words.  This will help when trying for <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2><span class=cmd>D&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;word&gt;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Define the word.
You can ask for definitions of <i>any</i> word - not just the ones in the puzzle.
No hints are tallied.
This form of the <span class=cmd>D</span> command serves as a quick and fun way to browse a dictionary that is more pleasant somehow (less clutter and noise!) than a full web site.  You can give multiple words on the command line.
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Definitions are from <a target=nytbee href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>.  These definitions are very brief because they&#8217;re just a hint.  Complete definitions would cover multiple meanings and multiple parts of speech.  Once a word is found and shown in the Found Word List you can click on it again to see the brief definition.<a href=#hotlink><sup class=red>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger;</sup></a>
The command <span class=cmd>Q</span> (or <span class=cmd>?</span>) will show the definition of the last word that was found.
Click on brief definitions to see the <i>complete</i> definition from wordnik.com in another window.
<p>
If there there is a <a href=#clues>clue</a> for a word it is shown
first followed by the dictionary definition.  
The power user command
<span class=cmd>OC</span>
will toggle between seeing <span class=cmd>o</span>nly the <span class=cmd>c</span>lues or seeing <i>both</i>
the clues and the definitions.  The default is to show both.

<tr><td colspan=2>Using <span class=cmd>E</span> instead of <span class=cmd>V</span> reveals letters at the front and at the End of the word.  Commands that would reveal the entire word (like V4B4) are silently ignored (as are commands like V1B8 or V2GA).</td></tr>

<h2>The Hint Table and the Two Letter List
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<p>
The <span class=green>Hint Table</span> (aka The Grid) (invoked with the <span class=cmd>HT</span> command) looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/hint_table.png>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>5</span> in the <b>M</b> row and the <b>6</b> column means that the the puzzle has <span class=blue>5</span> words beginning with <b>M</b> of length <b>6</b>.
<p>
The <span class=green>Two Letter List</span> (invoked with the <span class=cmd>TL</span> command) looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/two_letter_list.png>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>GE-4</span> means that the puzzle has <b>4</b> words beginning with <b>GE</b>.
<p>
There are <span class=red>two important things</span> 
about the table and list.
<ol>
<li>They are <b><i>DYNAMIC</i></b>.  As you discover and enter words,
the numbers in the table and lists will <i>change</i>.
The numbers represent the number of words that <i>remain</i> to be found.
<li>You can <b>click</b> on the entries in the table and lists to
get definitions <i>and clues</i> for the words.
</ol>
<p>
For those who work on the puzzle at nytimes.com or with
the NYT mobile app and would like the Table and List
to be dynamic there <i>is</i> a solution:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee href='https://logicalpoetry.com/bee'>logicalpoetry.com/bee</a>
</ul>
Select and Copy the words you have found, Paste them into the text field,
and hit Return.   The Table and List will show
<i>only</i> the missing words.  This applies, of course, only
to today&#8217;s puzzle.   Duplicate, invalid, and stray words will be
silently ignored.
<a name=hint></a>
<h2>Hint Strategy
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = Queen Bee <i>all by myself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
There are many ways to get hints and
each increases your
&#8220;hint total&#8221;.
The number of hints are tallied like so:
<p>
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Hint Command</th><th align=left colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;# hints</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>HT</span></td><td align=right>10</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TL</span></td><td align=right>5</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D</span></td><td align=right>3</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V,E</span></td><td align=right>2</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>1</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>2</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DR</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D5</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>51</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>52</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>#B, #4, #&gt;4</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>#</span></td><td align=right>0</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>BT</span></td><td align=right>0</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>G&nbsp;Y</span></td><td align=right>5</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Some people do not mind how many hints they need to achieve Queen Bee.
It <i>is</i> just a game and they feel that games should be fun. &#128521;
If I make it to the rank of Amazing all by myself I call it a very good day.
And some days I consider it a success
if the Hint total is less than the Score. &#128522;
<p>
The <span class=cmd>I</span> (info) command
shows the names of the people who provided <a href=#clues>clues</a>.
Clicking on a name will show <i>all</i> of their clues.
This will not cost you any hint points <i>at all</i>
and is one of many ways that you can &#8220;cheat&#8221;!
<p>
Note that with enough hints you can <i>always</i> make it to Queen Bee.
For example, with the 5 letter word MAGMA you could ask
for the hints V4MA and E2MA to get all 5 of the letters.
<p>
<a name=hint_ratio></a>
Once the rank of Amazing is reached the ratio of hints
to total score is shown.  Here&#8217;s an example of where I struggled
to get to Queen Bee after I got to Genius &#128549;:

<h2>Games within the Game
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Achieving &#8220;Queen Bee All By Myself&#8221; (QBABM) is the ultimate goal but
for most of us mere mortals it is rarely achieved.
There <i>are</i> other fun ways to play:
<ul>
<li>The Pangram Game - Get random games (with the command <span class=cmd>NR</span>) and find all of the pangrams.  The commands <span class=cmd>DP</span> and <span class=cmd>V1P</span> can help.  You can periodically clear
your list of games with the <span class=cmd>XA</span> command.
<li><a href=#gn4l>Genius No 4 Letter</a> (GN4L) - Find only 5+ letter words to reach the Genius level.  The commands <span class=cmd>51</span>, <span class=cmd>52</span>, and <span class=cmd>D5</span> can help.  You can also try for GOTN (On the Nose).
<li><a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> - Get random Bingo games (with the command <span class=cmd>NRB</span>) and try for the various levels of Bingo achievement.  The command <span class=cmd>BT</span> can help.
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about your hint total and just keep asking for hints
(via the <span class=cmd>D</span>, <span class=cmd>V</span>, and <span class=cmd>E</span> commands) until you get to Queen Bee.   This is
still an accomplishment!  Using brief definitions to find words
is a way to challenge and enlarge your vocabulary.
You can use <span class=cmd>DR</span> to get definitions <i>and</i> any clues for random unfound words.
<li>You could do <i>all</i> of the above
by resetting the puzzle between the games with the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command.
<li>Find all the words and get to Queen Bee however you want
and then reset the game (with <span class=cmd>C Y</span>) and see if you can
remember the words.  If you keep doing this your <a href=#hint_ratio>hint ratio</a> should get lower and lower.
<li>Find as many <a href=#bonus>Bonus</a> words as you can.
There is, of course, no &#8220;official&#8221; list of
these words but you can tell your friends about how many you found.
You can also search for <a href=#donut>Donut</a>
and Lexicon words.
Searching for these &#8220;Extra&#8221; words is, for me,
a more creative and fun
way to spend WordPlay time that is much more diverting than simply
finding hidden words that someone else has chosen. &#128540;
The <span class=cmd>CW</span> command will show you how other
people are doing with the Extra words and introduces a bit of
<a href=#competition>fun competition</a>.
Another little game is to try to maximize your <a href=#boa>BOA Score</a>.
Note that the command <span class=cmd>C Y</span> clears puzzle words but
not the Extra words.  If you want to start <i>completely</i> fresh the
command <span class=cmd>C YA</span> will clear <i>all</i> words.
<li>A different kind of activity is to find all the words in today&#8217;s puzzle
(however you wish, even with the <span class=cmd>G YP</span> command &#128556;) and
then add some clever inventive <a href=#clues>clues</a>.
This will help everyone else
who is playing the game with this software.  You can also copy and paste
your clues into the NYT Spelling Bee forum to help the larger world-wide HiveMind.
<li>Finally, you could <a href='#create'>create your own puzzle</a> and
give it as a gift to one of your friends.  Their name could be one of the pangrams - or one of the words in the allowed list! &#128525;
</ul>
<a name=bingo></a>
<h2>Bingo
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
If each of the 7 letters in a puzzle is the first letter of at
least one word in the
list of allowed words then this is called a &#8220;Bingo&#8221;.
It is called &#8220;Bingo&#8221; in reference to the real <a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)'>Bingo</a> game where
you win if you complete a row, column, or diagonal.
Not all puzzles are Bingo puzzles but there are many.
In the first 1530 puzzles in the <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a>
650 were Bingo puzzles.
The <span class=cmd>I</span> command will tell you if a puzzle is a Bingo as
does the graphical status (<a href=#st>see the command <span class=cmd>ST</span></a>).
When you enter a word that completes a Bingo you get a congratulatory message.
There are 4 levels of Bingo achievement:
<ul>
1 - YES, you achieved a BINGO! &#128077;<br>
2 - In the FIRST 7 words you found! &#128077; &#128077;<br>
3 - Even better, they were found in ALPHABETICAL order! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
4 - AND with a MINIMUM score! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
 or<br>
4 - AND with a MAXIMUM score! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;
</ul>
Trying to achieve these levels of Bingo are little games
within the game that some people enjoy.  It is much easier than QBABM!
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>BT</span> (Bingo Table) shows a subset of the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a>.  For each of the 7 letters it shows the <i>lengths</i> of the words with minimum and maximum <i>scores</i>.  This helps when you are aiming for level 4 Bingo.  For example (from 1/22/21):
<ul>
<table cellpadding=6>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>C</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>E</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>I</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>N</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>O</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>T</th>
<th style='text-align: center'>V</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=rt>Min</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
<td class='rt blue'>5</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
<td class='rt blue'>5</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
<td class='rt blue'>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=rt>Max</td>
<td class='rt blue'>10</td>
<td class='rt blue'>8</td>
<td class='rt blue'>12</td>
<td class='rt blue'>8</td>
<td class='rt blue'>5</td>
<td class='rt blue'>8</td>
<td class='rt blue'>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td class='red rt'>*</td>
<td class='red rt'>*</td>
<td class='red rt'>*</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>
In this puzzle the word INCONVENIENCE (13) is longer than <span class=green>INCONVENIENT</span> (12) but the latter is a pangram.  Pangram numbers are marked with a red asterisk.
<p>
<span class=cmd>BT</span> does not tally any <a href=#hint>hint points</a>.
<p>
As in the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a> the numbers in the BT table are <i>links</i> - to show a brief definition of the word(s). <span class=cmd>BT</span> is a toggle - the default is off.
If a puzzle is not a Bingo no table will be shown.
<p>
If you enjoy Bingo games there is the command <span class=cmd>NRB</span> which will start a <span class=cmd>N</span>ew <span class=cmd>R</span>andom <span class=cmd>B</span>ingo puzzle from the NYT <a href='#nyt_archive'>archive</a>.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>TOP</span> command shows Bingo achievement scores that are tallied like this:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=2>
<tr><td>First 7 words</td><td>&nbsp;1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alphabetical Order</td><td>&nbsp;2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Minimum Score</td><td>&nbsp;4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Maximum Score</td><td>&nbsp;8</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
The maximum Bingo score in <span class=cmd>TOP</span> is 18: min (1 + 2 + 4) + max (1 + 2 + 8) = 18.
The total number of hints needed is also shown.
Note that to do both min and max Bingo you need the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command between them.
<span class=cmd>SWA</span> is better than <span class=cmd>C Y</span> - see <a href=#stash>The Stash</a>.
<a name=gn4l></a>
<h2>Genius No 4 Letter
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Another little game within the game is achieving the rank of Genius
without any 4 letter words.  The abbreviation for this in the HiveMind forum
is GN4L (<span class=cmd>G</span>enius <span class=cmd>N</span>o <span class=cmd>4</span> <span class=cmd>L</span>etter).
<p>
Since 4 letter words are only valued at 1 point, attaining GN4L is almost always possible.
In the first 1530 games in the <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a> there were
only 8 games where GN4L was <i>not</i> possible. 10/8/19 is one example.
If GN4L cannot be achieved this is noted in the output of the 'I' (info) command.
<p>
Even though it is almost always possible, getting to GN4L isn&#8217;t easy
and here are a few commands to help:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D5</span></td><td>Define a random word not yet found that has 5 or more letters.  Note that if you only have 5+ letter words in your found list the DR command will do much the same as the D5 command.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>51</span></td><td>Show a random non-zero entry from the Hint Table where the length is 5 or more.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>52</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Two Letter List of words with a length of 5 or more.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
When you achieve GN4L you get a congratulatory message:
<ul>
Genius &#128077;&#128077;<br>
And you did it without ANY 4 letter words! &#128522;
</ul>
<a name=gotn></a>
A minor (relatively easy) variation on GN4L is GOTN - <span class=cmd>G</span>enius <span class=cmd>O</span>n <span class=cmd>T</span>he <span class=cmd>N</span>ose.
This is where your point total is <i>exactly</i> at the beginning
of the Genius level.  Genius is 70% of the maximum point total (Queen Bee).
GOTN requires that you achieve GN4L at the same time.  There is
this additional congratulatory message for GOTN:
<ul>
On the Nose! <span style='font-size: 24pt'>&#128067;</span> &#128522;
</ul>
<p>
Two another Genius level variants are when you did not need
a Pangram to reach Genius.  The codes for these are: GN4L-NP and GOTN-NP.
If GN4L-NP is not possible this is also noted in the I (info) command.
<p>
<ul>
And with No Pangrams! &#128526; &#128588;
</ul>
<p>
The <span class=cmd>PG</span> command will tell you how many more points you need to reach the Genius level. If you are at or over Genius it reports how many more words you need to reach Queen Bee.
<p>
As you get close to Genius you can consult the Hint Table to see if there is a 5+ letter word remaining that will get you to Genius exactly.  If not, you could <i>stash</i> a word with the <span class=cmd>SW</span> command like this: <span class=cmd>SW</span> &lt;word&gt;.  This will adjust your score so you can then have other ways to make the score match the Genius level exactly. 
<a name=stash></a>
<h2>The Stash
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
When striving for <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> or <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a>
you can effectively use "the stash".  The Stash is a place you can
store words that you have found but don&#8217;t want to enter quite yet.
Let&#8217;s say you are trying for minimal <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> with
this puzzle:
<p style="margin-left: .5in">
<img width=250 src=pics/stash.png>
</p>
There are several 4 letter words in the <span class=cmd>BT</span>
table.  As you are looking for them you might see a pangram
or 5+ letter words that do not fit in with minimal Bingo.
You can &#8220;stash&#8221; these words
so you don&#8217;t forget them!
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SW CONDITION ADDICT DICTA</spaN>
</ul>
<span class=cmd>SW</span> stands for <span class=cmd>S</span>tash <span class=cmd>W</span>ords.
<p>
More conveniently, the <span class=cmd>SW</span> (or just an S) could be entered <i>at the end</i>, if you wish:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CONDITION ADDICT DICTA SW</span><br>
or<br>
<span class=cmd>CONDITION ADDICT DICTA S</span>
</ul>
<p>
Note that words are checked before stashing.  Only valid puzzle
words are stashed.  Extra words will be added as usual.
<p>
Note that if you see a Bonus or Donut word
it&#8217;s okay to enter them <i>whenever</i> you wish.
The <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command will <i>not</i> clear them.
<p>
When you finish with minimal Bingo you likely want to
go on to maximal Bingo (which is much harder) or <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a>.
But you don&#8217;t want to
forget the 4 letter words you entered!  There is a command to help:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SWA</span>
</ul>
This will stash <span class=cmd>a</span>ll of your puzzle words.
<p>
The words in the Stash are shown below the Donut, Lexicon, and Bonus words.
Something like this:
<ul>
Stash: Acid Addict Coda Condition Dicta Data ...
</ul>
When you go on <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a> you can add all of
the 5+ letter words in the stash with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA5</span>
</ul>
The stash will now contain only 4 letter words:
<ul>
Stash: Acid Coda Data ...
</ul>
When you reach reach Genius and <a href=#gn4l>GN4L</a> you can now enter
your remembered 4 letter stash words with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA</span>
</ul>
<span class=cmd>SA</span> stands for <span class=cmd>S</span>tash <span class=cmd>A</span>dd.  <i>All</i> words will be UNstashed.
<p>
There is a variant on the <span class=cmd>SA</span> command:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA XX</span>
</ul>
XX can be any letters you wish.   Only the words in the stash
that <i>contain</i> an XX will be UNstashed.  This would be useful if
you saw a pangram during minimal bingo and stashed it and then you wanted
to enter the pangram when doing maximal bingo.  Without this command
you would have to re-enter it.  For example, the pangram for the
above puzzle is ADDICTION. If the stash contained:
<ul>
ACIDIC ADDICT ADDICTION ANACONDA CICADA 
</ul>
you could UNstash ADDICTION with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA TI</span><br>
or<br>
<span class=cmd>SA IO</span>
</ul>
<p>
Another (and likely easier) way to UNstash a word is to first click
on it to get its definition.  Above the definition there will be
a link labeled 'UNstash'.  Click on it do the unstashing.
<ul>
<img src=pics/unstash.png height=100 border=1>
</ul>
A fun variant of this is when you want to stash a word that
is already in your list of <i>found</i> puzzle words - perhaps
to help achieve <a href=#gotn>GOTN</a>.  Click on the word for a definition.
You will have a link labeled 'Stash'.
<p>
For power users: In the command <span class=cmd>SA XX</span> the XX is actually a <a target=_blank href='https://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut'>Perl regular expression</a> so with this in the stash:
<ul>
CHALLAH CHALLENGE HALL HANG LEECH TENT
</ul>
You could unstash CHALLENGE with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA E$</span>
</ul>
because it is the only word that ends in E.
And you could unstash LEECH with:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SA ^L</span>
</ul>
because it is the only word that begins with L.
<a name=donut></a>
<h2>Donut, Lexicon, and Bonus Words
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<h3>Donut</h3>
While searching hunting foraging for words that are in the &#8220;allowed list&#8221;
it often happens that you see a real word that does not contain the center
letter.  These words are called &#8220;Donut Words&#8221; because the 6 non-center letters
form a circle (or torus) with a hole - like a donut or 
<a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut'>doughnut</a>.
This puzzle from May 27, 2022:
<p style="margin-left: .2in">
<img width=370 src=pics/donut.jpg>
</p>
had more than 50 (!) Donut Words including Again, Agar, Agrarian,
<span class=purple>Arming</span>,
<span class=green>Grammarian</span>,
and <span class=purple>Margin</span>.  Another Donut Word is &#8220;Anagram&#8221;
which had never occurred in an NYT Spelling Bee before - how fun is that! &#128522; (It has since been used for the first and only time on 9/24/23).
Note that <span class=purple>Arming</span>, <span class=green>Grammarian</span>, and <span class=purple>Margin</span> are <i>pangram</i> donut words because
they use all 6 letters.  <span class=purple>Arming</span> and <span class=purple>Margin</span> are <i>perfect</i> pangram donut words because they are 6 letters long.  
<p>
Donut Words are deemed acceptable if they occur in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>
or have appeared before in an NYT Bee Puzzle
OR if they have a definition at
<a target=_blank href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>.
<p>
If you try to find Donut (or Lexicon) words by typing words that you don&#8217;t know
and suspect <i>may</i> be a valid word you may be pleasantly surprised
that it is indeed an acceptable word.  For example:
<br>
<img width=430 src=pics/teet.png>
<br>
So now you are probably wondering what TEET means, right?
You can click on the red <span style="color: red">TEET</span>
and a definition will be shown.  Nice!   Another way to see the definition
of the last word that was found is the <span class=cmd>Q</span> (or <span class=cmd>?</span>) command.
<p>
To faciliate your search for Donut words you can toggle into &#8220;Donut Mode&#8221; with the command <span class=cmd>DN</span>.   This will only show Donut words you have found and the center letter will disappear because you won&#8217;t be using it.  
When you toggle the letter display with <span class=cmd>H</span> to show the letters in a straight line the center letter will be omitted.  Toggle <i>out</i> of Donut Mode with the command <span class=cmd>DN</span> as well.
<h3>Lexicon</h3>
Another type of word is one that IS a real valid actual proper qualified word
containing the center letter but which for some mysterious, arbitrary,
rational, or irrational reason was not included in the &#8220;allowed list&#8221;.
In this puzzle:
<p>
<img width=340 src=pics/donut.png>
<br>
the words WAIN and WANG are such valid words that
were not included in the allowed list - because they are rare or obscure?
These disallowed words are the subject of many many repetitous and lengthy
discussions and debates in the HiveMind Forum.  One example is
the word URTICARIA - see 
<a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/crosswords/spelling-bee-forum.html#commentsContainer'>the NYT HiveMind forum for May 16, 2022</a>.
These words are called &#8220;Lexicon Words&#8221; because they <b>are</b> to be found
in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>.
<a name=bonus></a>
<h3>Bonus</h3>
When seeking questing looking for words in the allowed list
how often have you muttered the phrase &#8220;<span class=green>If only I had an E...</span>&#8221;?
For this, there are <i>Bonus</i> words.  A Bonus word is at least 6
letters long, uses some of the 7 letters
(<i>not</i> necessarily including the center one),
and an <i>additional</i> letter that is <i>not</i> one of the 7.
<p>
In this puzzle from November 13, 2022:
<p style="margin-left: .4in">
<img src=pics/22-11-13.png width=300>
<p>
the words VICINIT<span class=red1>Y</span> and INCITE<span class=red1>M</span>ENT are Bonus words which use an additional Y and M respectively.
Bonus words must appear either in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>
or in the list of previous
NYT Puzzle words
OR if they have a definition at
<a target=_blank href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>.
The additional letter <i>can</i> be an <span class=red1 style="font-size: 20pt">S</span> (finally!).
<span class=red1>S</span>CIENCE is another Bonus word for the above puzzle. 
<p>
Note that very few plurals occur in the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>
and that many words ending in ING and ED are absent as well.
<a target=_blank href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>
<i>does</i> have definitions for most plurals.
Since this would result in a plethora of Bonus words just by adding
an S (or ES) to Donut words that are nouns (or verbs) these type of Bonus words
are not allowed.  Apologies for those who enjoy accumulating vast
quantities of Bonus words. &#128522;
<p>
It seems that Bonus words are often more colorful and intriguing
than the typical boring &#8220;normal&#8221; words.
<p>
Playing Spelling Bee hopefully expands our vocabulary.
But â€¦ if you only play the standard puzzle your vocabulary
is biased by words with &lt;= 7 unique letters.
AND no words with S or both E & R. ðŸ˜œ
Bonus words expand that a little.
<p>
On May 16, 2022 this was the NYT Puzzle:
<p>
<img src=pics/20220516.png width=280 style="margin-left: .5in">
<p>
And here is a screenshot from the NYT Spelling Bee HiveMind Forum on that day:
<p>
<img src=pics/nearly-words.png width=600 border=1>
<p>
This is evidence that Donut and Bonus words are a troublesome
issue for those who only play on the NY Times site!
On <i>this</i> site they are an added fun competitive challenge. &#128522;
<p>
A <span class=green>Bonus Pangram</span> is one that uses all 7 letters plus the extra one.  In the above puzzle <span class=green>ARCHITECTURE</span> would be a Bonus Pangram.
A <span class=purple>Perfect Bonus Pangram</span> is exactly 8 letters long.
There is yet <span style="color: magenta"><i>another</i></span> type of Bonus Pangram &ndash; which I will leave
undocumented so you can have the pleasure of discovering it on your own.
<p>
When searching for Bonus words this list of words
from the large lexicon may help:
<ul>
<a target=_blank href=words23.html>6+ Letter Words with 2 or 3 Unique Letters</a>
</ul>
<h3>Extra Word Lists</h3>
These three types of words (the term &#8220;Extra Words&#8221; seems a good one) are
listed below the words you have found in the allowed list.  Like so:
<p style="margin-left: .2in">
<img src=pics/list3.png width=600>
<p>
Note that the command <span class=cmd>C Y</span> will clear puzzle words but
leave the Extra words.  <span class=cmd>C YA</span> will clear <i><span class=cmd>a</span>ll</i> words.
<a name=bonus_mode></a>
<h3>Bonus Mode</h3>
Searching for Bonus words on a mobile phone is somewhat awkward.
The additional letter is (of course!) not in the 7 displayed letters
so you need to enter the words in the text field.
The onscreen keyboard occupies a lot of the screen real estate.
The command <span class=cmd>BN</span> can help with this.
When it is toggled ON you are in Bonus Mode and 
the mobile display will look like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/teenage.png width=800 border=1>
<p>
The 19 (26-7=19) additional letters are put in a table.
Tap on them to append to the word.
If a Bonus word has been found using a letter it will be <span class=green>green</span>.
There are also command links for
<span class=cmd>Stash</span>,
<span class=cmd>Own</span>,
<s><span class=cmd>Bonus</span></s>,
<span class=cmd>Enter</span>,
<span class=cmd>Delete</span>,
and
<span class=cmd>Standings</span>.
<ul>
<li><span class=cmd>Stash</span>, <span class=cmd>Enter</span>, and <span class=cmd>Delete</span> have the usual functions.
<li><span class=cmd>Own</span> will issue the <span class=cmd>OW</span> command to show what words only you have found.
<li><s><span class=cmd>Bonus</span></s> will toggle OUT of Bonus Mode.
<li><span class=cmd>Standings</span> will issue the <span class=cmd>CW</span> command for you (see <a href=#competition>below</a>).
</ul>
The letter table also has a green square &#129001; at the end
that will insert a space.  This is useful for issuing various commands.
<p>
When NOT on a mobile phone the <span class=cmd>BN</span> command 
will put the 19 additional letters above the list of Bonus words.
<p>
Note that when in Bonus Mode only Bonus words are shown &ndash; no Puzzle, Donut or Lexicon words.
And since you are not looking for puzzle words, the
Status (numeric or graphical), Hint Table, and Two Letter
List are hidden as well.
This helps you focus on finding those elusive colorful intriguing Bonus words!
<a name=boa></a>
<h3>Your BOA Score</h3>
Can you find a Bonus word using <i>each</i> of the 19 additional letters?
Sometimes it is possible.  If there is no U in the puzzle you likely
cannot find a Bonus word using a Q.  J, X, and Z may not be possible either.
These letters <i>are</i> the highest value Scrabble letters for a reason!
The command <span class=cmd>BOA</span>
will show your <span class=cmd>B</span>onus words
in <span class=cmd>O</span>rder of the
<span class=cmd>A</span>dditional letter.  Appended to this list is
the count of how many additional letters were used in a
Bonus word - this is your BOA Score.
<h3>Scrabble</h3>
Looking for Bonus words is similar to
playing <a target=_blank href='https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/rules'>Scrabble</a>.  In Scrabble
you have 7 letters in your rack and you need to find <i>another</i> letter
already on the board to place your word.
Finding Bonus words is easier than Scrabble
because you can simply <i>choose</i> whatever other letter you need!
It's also like having a blank tile in your rack and that tile
can be any letter you wish.
<h3>Global Lists of Extra Words</h3>
There is, of course, no &#8220;official&#8221; list of these Extra words.
This makes it more fun, in a way.  More creative.
Here are 7 commands to show the Extra words found by the
<i>entire</i> global world-wide community.
You cannot use these commands on the same day of the puzzle &ndash; otherwise, people
could &#8220;cheat&#8221; and use words found by others, yes?
The command <span class=cmd>Y</span> is convenient here to go
to yesterday&#8217;s puzzle.
The words that <i>you</i> found are shown in
<span class=found_bonus>sky blue</span>.
<span class=green>Pangrams</span> and <span class=purple>Perfect Pangrams</span> are marked.
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>DW</th><td>Show all Donut words in alphabetic order.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>LW</th><td>Show all Lexicon words in alphabetic order.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>BW</th><td>Show all Bonus words in alphabetic order.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>NDW</th><td>Show all Donut words in order of how many different people found them.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>NLW</th><td>Show all Lexicon words in order of how many different people found them.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>NBW</th><td>Show all Bonus words in order of how many different people found them.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>ABW</th><td>Show all Bonus words in order of the additional letter.  Within that additional letter the sort is by the number of people who found the word and then alphabetically. At the end are tallies of the number of words containing the center letter and also by length.</td></tr>
</table>
If you see a word you don&#8217;t know you can click on it to see a brief definition
(and then go back in the browser to see the list again) and, as usual, click on the brief definition to see a complete definition at wordnik.com.
<p>
Note: These lists of words can change <i>after</i> the day of the puzzle.
Furthermore, as a &#8220;very big cheat&#8221; you could select, copy, and paste all of the words into the text box to add to your collection.

<h3>Competition</h3>
Two commands that show how you are doing with respect to others:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>OW</th><td>This tells you which
Extra words were found <b><span class=cmd>O</span>nly By You</b>.<br>
When an extra word is entered you are informed if it is an &#8220;Own&#8221; word.
<ul>
<span style="color: red">WORLDLY</span>: Bonus Own word &#128077;
</ul>
Of course, someone else may enter it later so it may not <i>stay</i> an Own word.
</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt' style="width: 15mm">CW</th><td>Community Words.
The 'C' could also stand for Competitive &#128522;.
Show the <a href=#screen_names>screen names</a>
of the 5 people who found the most
Extra words (Bonus, Donut, and Lexicon) for the current NYT puzzle.
For example:
<br>
<img src=pics/cw.png width=400>
<br>
CW 10 will show the top 10.
Note that this command only shows the counts of words that were found <b>on</b>
the day the puzzle was released.  This command <i>can</i> be
entered throughout the day of the puzzle.
<span class=cmd>CW</span> introduces
a fun competitive drive to try to find more and more words.
Note that CW also shows OW and BOA scores.

<h2>Discussion Forum
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
We are social beings.  We like to share.
The HiveMind Forum of the New York Times is a very active community
of people who enjoy the challenge of the daily puzzle and
also enjoy discussing it.  Yes, it is full of complaints and bragging
but that's okay! &#128522;  There is also a great deal of poetry
and clues and analysis and all kinds of clever literary fun.
<p>
This enhanced Bee has a discussion forum as well.   It is

<a name=colors></a>
<h2>Colors
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The <span class=cmd>CO</span> command controls the <span class=cmd>co</span>lors.
You can change the color of nearly everything you see.
Rather than being stuck with the standard NYT gray/gold hexagon:
<ul>
<img src=pics/hive.png width=180>
</ul>
and having it forever etched and <b>burned</b> into your retinas
you can have fun experimenting with different hues.
Perhaps your favorite color is <span style='color: skyblue'>sky blue</span>.
Or on Tuesdays you feel like a spicy <span style="color: pink">pink</span>/<span style="color: magenta">magenta</span>/<span style="color: red">red</span>.
Or on the weekends you want <span style="color: #777777">different</span> <span style="color: #999999">shades</span> <span style="color: aaaaaa">of</span> <span style="color: #dddddd">gray</span>.
<ul>
<img src=pics/blue.png width=170>
&nbsp;&nbsp
<img src=pics/spicy.png width=170>
&nbsp;&nbsp
<img src=pics/gray.png width=170>
</ul>
<h3>PreSet Colors</h3>
The simplest way to change the colors is with the 7 PreSets A to G:
<style>
.cc {
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
<ul>
<table cellpadding=10 border=1>
<tr><th>Command</td><th align=left>Name</th><th>Center Colors</th></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO A</td><td>NYT Standard</td>
<td class=cc style="background: gold; color: black;">A</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO B</td><td>The Blues</td>
<td class=cc style="background: cornflowerblue; color: midnightblue;">B</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO C</td><td>Floral</td>
<td class=cc style="background: firebrick; color: hotpink;">C</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO D</td><td style="background: black; color: white">Dark Mode</td>
<td class=cc style="background: gold; color: black;">D</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO E</td><td>Black and White</td>
<td class=cc style="background: rgb(204,204,204); color: rgb(178,178,178);">E</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO F</td><td>Lilac Spring</td>
<td class=cc style="background: teal; color: white;">F</td></tr>
<tr><td class=cmd>CO G</td><td>Green Haze</td>
<td class=cc style="background: darkgreen; color: white;">G</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Each of these PreSets has a different mood and feel.
Try them all.  It's okay to leave out the space - so COA, COB, COC, etc. will work.
<p>
These PreSets are nice but you will very likely want to tweak them
in various ways to create your own snazzy color scheme(s).
However you set and tweak the colors they will be remembered &ndash; they are
tied to your <a href=#identity>ID</a> so they will be preserved
from day to day and across browsers.
<h3>Precise Control of Colors</h3>
You have very fine control over the colors
but it is rather complex and takes a lot of explaining.
You can change the colors of 9 different areas:
<ol>
<li>The background of the center letter.
<li>The text of the center letter.
<li>The background of the donut letters (the 6 outer letters).
<li>The text of the donut letters.
<li>The background of the entire page.
<li>The text on the page (word lists, definitions, etc).
<li>The clickable links.
<li>The background of the command input field.
<li>The text in the command input field.
</ol>
<p>
<img src=pics/color.jpg width=750 border=1>
<p>
The <span class=cmd>CO</span> command by itself
will show a table of the current color settings:
<ul>
<style>
/* align td left just for the co table */
.co td {
    text-align: left;
}
</style>
<table cellpadding=3 class=co>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Center background</td><td>CORNFLOWERBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Center text</td></td><td>MIDNIGHTBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Donut background</td></td><td>LAVENDER</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Donut text</td></td><td>MEDIUMBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Page background</td></td><td>LIGHTBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Page text</td></td><td>RGB(102,102,102)</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Links</td></td><td>CORNFLOWERBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Input background</td></td><td>SKYBLUE</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Input text</td></td><td>DARKBLUE</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Here&#8217;s an example of how to change
the background (#1) and text (#2) of the center letter:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CO&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;RED&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;PINK</span>
</ul>
You give pairs &ndash; an area number (1-9) and a color for that area.
<p>
Colors can be expressed in 4 different ways:
<ol>
<li>The standard HTML color name - see this <a target=_blank href='https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp'>name reference</a>.  There are 140 different fun names - like <span style="color: orchid">Orchid</span> and
<span style="color: aquamarine">Aquamarine</span> &#128522.
<li>3 decimal rgb values (red-green-blue) - like this: rgb(45,140,210).  The rgb values are from 0 to 255.  
See this <a target=_blank href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_rgb.asp'>rgb reference</a>.  The red, green, and blue combine to make more than 16 million different colors (256*256*256 = 16,777,216).
<li>6 hexadecimal digits - like this: #04FA99. The 3 hex digit pairs
represent the values of red, green, and blue - from 00 to FF (instead of 0 to 255).
See this <a target=_blank href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_hex.asp'>hex reference</a>.
<li>Shades of gray - G1 (nearly black) to G9 (whitish).
</ol>
The 3 references above have color mixers and color pickers that are
fun to play with.  You can find a color you like and then
select-copy-paste the rgb or hex color values.
<p>
Here&#8217;s another command
to change the page background (#5) and link (#7) colors:
<p>
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CO&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;LAVENDER&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;#B21F1F</span>
</ul>
And the input text (#9) and the page text (#6):
<p>
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CO&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;G4&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;RGB(200,120,190)</span>
</ul>
<a name=schemes></a>
<h3>Color Schemes</h3>
You may want to have a <i>collection</i>
of several favorite color combinations (aka Color Schemes).
Perhaps one for weekday mornings and another for late night.
Once you have configured a set of colors you really like
you should save it by name with the <span class=cmd>SCO</span> command:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>SCO&nbsp;LATE</span>
</ul>
Your color scheme name cannot be one of the standard HTML Color Names nor
can it be a single letter as they are reserved for the PreSets.
<p>
<span class=cmd>CO</span> is used to put one of your color schemes in place:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>CO&nbsp;&nbsp;MORN</span>
</ul>
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>LCO</span> will list your color schemes.
They can be deleted with <span class=cmd>XCO</span>:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>XCO&nbsp;&nbsp;PURP</span>
</ul>
Note that 16 million different colors in 9 different areas
create more than 10<sup>65</sup> possible combinations!  That&#8217;s plenty
of room for self expression.  See the <a href=#calc><sup class=red>&dagger;&dagger;</sup></a> footnote for the fun calculation.

<h2>Clues for Puzzles
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Getting dictionary definitions for words with the
<span class=cmd>D</span> command
is nice &ndash; even though some people would consider it &#8220;cheating&#8221; &#128521;.
Even more fun is to look at <b>clues</b> generously provided by
members of the HiveMind.  These clues are often humorous and clever
wordplay - as in crossword puzzle clues.  The word &#8220;clue&#8221; is used here
instead of &#8220;hint&#8221;.  These clues are much more creative and entertaining than
formal dictionary definitions or revealed letters.
<p>
You can write clues when you create a Community Puzzle as seen <a href=#create>below</a>.
You can <i>also</i> create clues for NYT Puzzles.
To make clues for today&#8217;s NYT puzzle there is this link:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee href='https://logicalpoetry.com/mkclues'>logicalpoetry.com/mkclues</a>
</ul>
Spoiler warning: This link will reveal <i>all</i> of the words.
<ul>
<li>Creating clues requires you to have a
<a href='#screen_names'>Screen Name and Identity String</a>.
<li>You don&#8217;t need to give clues for every word.
<li>You can get dictionary definitions of the words to give
you some ideas.  Clicking on the words will give a brief definition.
Click on the brief definition to see the <i>complete</i> definition in another window.
<li>If you have given clues for a word before (such as for
frequently occuring words
like LOLL, NOON or TOOT) your clues will be offered and you can
cycle through them.
<li>If you want a multi-line clue put &lt;br&gt; at the end of lines.
<li>On Apple&#8217;s OSX emojis can be inserted into clues with control-command-space.
</ul>
When you have finished with your clues they are all presented in a nice format.
In fact, there are 6 <i>different</i> nice formats in which to see your clues.
Choose your preferred format and then click on &#8220;Ok&#8221;.  This will do two things:
<ol>
<li>Clear the format choices.
<li>Copy the clues onto the system clipboard.
</ol>
Then, if you wish, you can Paste your clues into the NYT HiveMind Forum.
In this way your clues can benefit those
people who are playing Spelling Bee with the NYT app or
the standard NYT web application.
<p>
When <i>playing</i> an NYT Puzzle, if clues have been provided,
there will be a red asterisk <span class=red>*</span> after the date at the top.
<p>
Clues are shown when you use the <span class=cmd>D</span> command.
If there are clues from multiple authors they will be color-coded.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>I</span> (information) command will show the
names of people who submitted clues.
Clicking on an author&#8217;s name will show the complete list of their clues.
Note that in this display,
if you&#8217;ve already found a word, that word is appended to the clue
and the whole line is in gray rather than black.  This helps you
focus on the clues for the words you have not yet found.
The tradition in the HiveMind Forum is that clues come in
the word alphabetical order and <i>can</i> have the length shown as well.
If you know this you have more information beyond the clue itself.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>CL</span> command will list the dates
of the NYT puzzles for which you have created clues. 
<p>
If you leave all of the clue fields blank
your clue offering is effectively deleted.

<h2>Creating a Community Puzzle
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Why should Sam Ezersky be the only one to have the fun
(and responsibility) of puzzle creation?
<b>You</b> can create your <i>own</i> puzzle to share with the
HiveMind community.  To do so just click on this link:
<a target=nytbee4 href='https://logicalpoetry.com/nytbee/mkpuz.html'>Create Puzzle</a>.
<p>
There are 5 steps to create a puzzle:
<style>
li {
    margin-bottom: 3mm;
}
</style>
<ol>
<li>Choose a &#8220;pangramic&#8221; word - a word with exactly 7 unique characters.
This ensures that there will be at least one pangram in your puzzle.
In the NYT puzzles the letter S does not occur at all but
here you <i>are</i> allowed to have an S in your word.
You can also use E and R in the same puzzle, if you wish.
<p>
How to find a pangramic word?  There are five different ways:
<ol style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'>
<li>On the page you will see links to 3 long
lists of pangramic words to choose from:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Pangrams from NYT Puzzles
<li>Pangramic words from a list of 10,000 common English words
<li>Pangramic words from the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a>
</ol>
These lists are disjoint.
<li>It is overwhelming to be confronted with such a large number
of word choices.  It&#8217;s nice to be offered a smaller number.
On the page you&#8217;ll see an <span class=rand>R5</span>
after the above 3 lists. They are links.
Clicking on them will show you 5 random pangramic words from that file.
Pressing Return will give you 5 more.
<li>If you have a word that you want to appear in the puzzle
you can search for pangramic words whose resulting puzzle
could have that word as part of the solution.    There is a second
text field for this purpose.
<p>
For example, the word &#8220;<span style="color: purple">enigma</span>&#8221; yields
&#8220;<span class=green>magazine</span>&#8221; from the NYT puzzles, &#8220;<span class=green>demanding examining messaging remaining</span>&#8221;
from the 10,000 word list, and 54 (!) words from the <a href=#lexicon>large lexicon</a> - most
of which are too esoteric for a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; puzzle.
However &#128522; ... among those 54 I do see these that are quite reasonable:
<ul class=green>
<li>beaming
<li>egomania
<li>imagines
<li>maddening
<li>margarine
<li>menacing
<li>menagerie
<li>migraine
<li>mismanage
</ul>
<li>You can simply enter 7 unique letters and and see if there are any words in the lists that use those 7.  Try, for example, <span class=green>abclrne</span>.
<li>Let&#8217;s say you have a friend named Bob Smith.  Notice that there are
exactly 7 unique letters in his name.  There are no pangramic words
in any of the above lists that use the letters 
<span class=green>bhimost</span> but we
can still proceed with making a puzzle for Bob.  Enter bobsmith
as the pangramic word and choose a center letter.
The &#8220;word&#8221; <span class=green>Bobsmith</span>
will be added to the &#8220;Other qualified&#8221; words and I&#8217;m sure you can
come up with a clever clue for Bobsmith that will make Bob Smith smile &#128522;.
</ol>
<li>Given your pangramic word, tallies are done of words, scores, 4 letter words, and pangrams by center letter.
Analyze these and choose a center letter.
<li>Choose which words to include in your puzzle.  This is the most
difficult part.  If you <i>don&#8217;t</i> include a common word or <i>do</i>
include a very rare or esoteric word you may be subject
to questioning and possible derision. &#128521;
Surprisingly, there are many common ordinary words that have not yet been used
in any NYT Puzzle.
You do not need to include <i>all</i> common ordinary words.
This is your own custom personalized puzzle and you can make your own rules!
<li>Give clues for the words, if you wish.  See the <a href=#clues>previous section</a> for
more details on entering the clues.
<li>Final steps:
<p>Your name and location.<br>
A title and description for your puzzle (optional).<br>
Is the puzzle is ready
to be &#8220;published&#8221; and available to the community?
<p>
Note that the description is subject to the same formatting as
<a href=#forum>Forum</a> posts.  e.g. *hello* becomes <b>hello</b>
</ol>
When these steps are complete your puzzle is assigned
a number and is immediately available to the community.
This number is used when giving the <span class=cmd>CP##</span> command.
CP here stands for Community Puzzle - a puzzle created by you for the HiveMind community!
<p>
A link will be displayed that looks like this:
<ul>
<span style="color: blue">https://logicalpoetry.com/cgi-bin/nytbee.pl/CP##</span>
</ul>
where ## is your puzzle number.  This link can be shared.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>LCP</span> command lists the community puzzles.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>RCP</span> command lists puzzles that I <span class=cmd>r</span>ecommend because I find them interesting, clever, or an unusual challenge.
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>YCP</span> will list the community puzzles
that you have created.  You can click on the <span class=blue>CP##</span> link
to re-edit your puzzle.  You can update/change/delete the words and clues - but not the 7 letters or center letter.
You can also change the title and description.
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>XCP&lt;num&gt;</span> can be used to <i>delete</i> puzzles
that <i>you</i> have created.
<p>
The description of your puzzle can be used to inform
people why you made the puzzle and explain any guidelines for
what words might be included or excluded.

will show only the Puzzle and Stash word lists.
This might be useful if you have found a great many Donut and Bonus words and
the long lists of them are distracting your search for Puzzle words.
The space is optional so <span class=cmd>WLPS</span> is okay.
<p>
Note that if you have issued <span class=cmd>WL&nbsp;&nbsp;PS</span> and then wish to
see ALL 5 of the word lists, just issue <span class=cmd>WLA</span> to see ALL.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>IM</span></td><td>Toggle the showing of the <span class=cmd>im</span>age for the ranks of Amazing, Genius, and Queen Bee.  Default is to show it.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2><a name=power_id></a>Preserving Your Identity</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>ID</span></td><td>Show the long string of characters that constitute your &#8220;identity&#8221; to the program.  It will look something like this:
<div class=long_string>963e4401-81eq-18ec-g81c-b1f85c942ex3<span></div>This command copies the long string to the system clipboard.  Save this string in a secure place.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>ID</span>&nbsp;...</td><td>In case you inadvertently clear your Website Data (aka cookies) you can restore your identity with this command:
<div class=long_string><span class=cmd>ID</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=green>963e4401-81eq-18ec-g81c-b1f85c942ex3</span></div> The long string of characters was retrieved from where you securely stored it.
This command also allows you to replicate your identity from one browser to another (e.g. Safari to Chrome or desktop browser to mobile browser).
<p>
The long string is computer generated and is guaranteed to be unique - but it
is long!  
A much easier way to establish your identity is to create a string
that you know is (very likely) unique to you - like your name plus your birthdate. For
example:
<ul>
    <span class=cmd>ID</span> <span class=green>GERTIE4/30</span>
</ul>
Now if your cookies were cleared you can easily re-establish your identity.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>WP</span></td><td>
After entering your own personalized screen name you
will have
access to the <span class=cmd>WP</span> command.
It shows '<span class=cmd>W</span>ho <span class=cmd>P</span>layed'.
It takes two forms:
<ul>
<span class=cmd>WP</span> 10<br>
Who played in the last 10 days?  And how often did they play?
</ul>
or
<ul>
<span class=cmd>WP</span> 3/4/23<br>
Who played on 3/4/23?
<p>
<span class=cmd>WP</span> 6/1<br>
(the year will default to the current year)
</ul>
<p>
Note that '<span class=cmd>W</span>ho <span class=cmd>P</span>layed' data goes back only to 1/1/2023.
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>Finally, we have the Ultimate Hint:</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>G&nbsp;&nbsp;Y</span></td><td>
Give up and show the words you have not yet found. <span class=cmd>G&nbsp;&nbsp;Y</span> means Give up and confirm Yes.  This just shows the words not yet found.  If you wish to actually have them entered append a P to the Y: <span class=cmd>G YP</span>.  That is P for paste or GYP for cheat or swindle. &#128556;</td></tr>

<h2>Other NYT Bee Projects
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The NY Times Spelling Bee concept has been a fertile source of challenge for
many clever software engineers.
<p>
<h3>Games You Can Play</h3>
<a target=nytbee href='https://quordle-wordle.com/spelling-bee'>https://quordle-wordle.com/spelling-bee</a> This site took all of the NYT puzzles and lets you play one of them at random.  You can't choose one by date.  No Hint Table or Two Letter List.  The list of found words is vertical which is less than helpful.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://bee.ignoble.dev'>bee.ignoble.dev {} Bee</a> 
- Generates a daily puzzle (not NYT) from the <a target=_blank href='http://aspell.net'>English Aspell Dictionary</a>.  There are puzzles going back to
5/17/2020.  Puzzles on Sunday have fewer than 41 words.  The number of
words increases through the week until Friday puzzles have more than
120 words.  Saturday puzzles have more than 120 words excluding the letters s and d.
Can sort the found words in 3 ways.
It has a "spoiler" mechanism to reveal all words.
I found a bug in the scoring: Some 4 letter words score more than 4!??
It keeps a tally of how many words of each length you need and have found.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://swilliams.io/fun/hex/'>swilliams.io.fun/hex</a>
- A Javascript implementation.  Fast.  Clean code.
Uses a file of 1,500 pangramic words and a file of 10,000
common words.  A different puzzle each day.  No ranks.
No hint table.  Not NYT Puzzles so not &#8220;curated&#8221;.  
Github repo is <a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/s-williams/Hexgame'>here</a>.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://freebee.fun'>freebee.fun</a>
is a free web version of the game that you can play!
Javascript and HTML/CSS.
It doesn&#8217;t use NYT words so the word list is not &#8220;curated&#8221;.
There is no hint table.
Source code in C is available for a command line version.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/philshem/open-spelling-bee'>Philip Shemella</a>
A command line game you can play written in Python.
Again, doesn't use NYT words.  It also generates new games.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://seanrayment.me/projects/nytimes-spelling-bee-clone/'>Cloning the NYT Bee</a> Written in node.js and other modern tools.  Only two games to play.  No hint table.  Choose &#8220;live demo&#8221; at the bottom.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://bumblewords.com'>bumblewords.com</a> A Javascript game.  Clean.  Not NYT Puzzles.  Cannot type - must click/tap.  It has a leaderboard.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qIxYZtqbw'>A sequence of 7 videos</a> The functionality of the NYT Spelling Bee is (sort of) replicated in Javascript/HTML/CSS.  The entire process is explained in great (<i>excruciating</i>) detail.
<h3>A Dynamic Hints Table</h3>
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/upshot/spelling-bee-buddy.html'>Spelling Bee Buddy</a> A valiant effort by a group of engineers and designers (Upshot?) to make a dynamic grid and two letter list.  There is some magic that connects the NYT puzzle to their site - on a per person basis.  They also try to provide hints/clues from people in the HiveMind that have offered a list of clues.  Pretty nice but awkward - the dynamic hint table is in another window.  What kind of communication do they use between the windows?
This same group produced the WordleBot.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://worker-bee.io'>worker-bee.io</a> No longer active. This was a dynamic Hint Table in Javascript - pretty but somewhat
fragile as it didn&#8217;t have the full word list.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://beesquared.ga'>beesquared.ga</a> Yet another dynamic Hint Table in Javascript similar to worker-bee.io.
<p>
<a target=_blank href='https://spellingbee.tips/hints'>Spelling Bee Tips</a> Clues and definitions and incremental revealing.  Can paste words from NYT puzzle.  Pretty fancy but awkward to use.  Where do the clues and definitions come from?
<p>
<a target=_blank href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honeycomb-hints/id6446508329'>Honeycomb Hints</a> An iOS app.  You upload a screenshot of your found words and the app extracts them and updates the Hint Table.  How are the words deduced from the image?  OCR?  Impressive - but troublesome to use.  It doesn't verify the words are in the "allowed list" or are even qualified.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://spelling-bee-assistant.app/'>Spelling Bee Assistant</a> An extension for the Chrome browser that interacts with the NY Times Spelling Bee site.  Provides dynamic counts.  No hints or definitions.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='http://ljkrakauer.com/LJK/20s/spellingbee.htm'>Excel Spreadsheet for the Hints Table</a> This updates the hint table as words are found and pasted in.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.thegamebureau.com/beesheet'>Spelling Bee Hint Worksheet</a> A kind of spreadsheet you print out and, with a pen or pencil, fill in the words you have found.  This is further proof that there is an unmet need for the grid to be dynamic.

<h3>NY Times Puzzle Answers</h3>
The 9 sites below show the list of allowed words in the
NY Times puzzle for each day.  In a variety of formats.
The intention is to help people solve the puzzle or, more accurately,
see what words they missed.  Most have annoying ads. &#128542;

<h3>NY Times Engineering Director</h3>

<h2>Without a Subscription?
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Is it illegal or unethical to play the NYT Spelling Bee puzzles without a subscription?
<p>
I <b>do</b> have a <a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/subscription'>subscription</a> to the Times.  It is a reliable,
trusted, and curated source of information in these troubled times.
<a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/subscription'>Subscriptions</a>
help the many journalists stay focused on their story.
<p>
When the puzzle page is loaded into the web browser
the list of allowed words
<i>is</i> visible &ndash; if you know where to look.
This is what you will see in the HTML/Javascript page source:
<pre>
window.gameData = {
    "today": {
    "expiration": 1638345600,
    "displayWeekday": "Tuesday",
    "displayDate": "November 30, 2021",
    "printDate": "2021/11/30",
    "centerLetter": "h",
    "outerLetters": ["d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "validLetters": ["h", "d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "pangrams": ["goodnight", "hotdogging"],
    "answers": ["goodnight", "hotdogging", "dhoti", "doth",
        "godhood", "goth", "hiding", "high", "hind",
        "hinging", "hint", "hinting", "hitting", "hogging",
        "honing", "hood", "hooding", "hoodoo", "hoot",
        "hooting", "hotdog", "nigh", "night", "ninth",
        "nothing", "thigh", "thin", "thing", "thinning",
        "thong", "tight", "tithing", "tonight", "tooth"],
...
</pre>
So the words in the puzzle <i>are</i> available publicly each day.
The new mechanism I created is simply an alternate way
of using these words.

<h2>Same 7 Letters
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
In the large NYT Spelling Bee <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a> there are many puzzles that share the
same set of 7 letters and hence the same pangrams.   
For example, there are 3 that
have occurred on 5 different dates:

The <span class=cmd>F7</span> command finds other dates that use the
same 7 letters as in the current puzzle.
These other puzzles usually (but not always)
have a different center letter.
Note these identical puzzles: 08/03/19 and 08/24/20.

<h2>NYT Archival Puzzles
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The archive was gathered mostly from
<a target=nytbee href=https://nytbee.com>nytbee.com</a>.
It is now added to daily at 3:00 a.m. EST by extracting the words
from the New York Times site.  There are daily puzzles going all the way
back to May 9, 2018.   There are now
<!-- Do NOT mess with the next two lines - see cgi-bin/nytbee_list.pl! -->
2123 puzzles with
a total of 9998 different words!
<p>
Which puzzles from the large archive to play?
You can get one at random with the <span class=cmd>NR</span> command or you could
choose one with various attributes like ones with the most points or the
fewest 4 letter words.
<p>
Starting an archival puzzle is simple.
Just enter the puzzle date (like 12/16/21)
in the text field where you would enter a word.
<p>
To facilitate your curiousity and research
you can see <a target=_blank href=list/nyt_puzzles.txt>this text file</a>
of the many puzzles.  The lines have this format:
<p>
<pre class=ind>
yyyymmdd => seven center pangrams ... | words ...
</pre>
For example:
<p>
<pre class=ind>
20180524 => abceklm k camelback clambake | aback alack ... meek
</pre>
Tallies are made of the many puzzles and words.
See this table of the puzzles:
<p class=ind>
<a target=_blank href='list/puzzle-date-asc.html'>NYT Spelling Bee Puzzles</a>
<p>
You will see date, 
center letter, # words, # pangrams, score, # four letter words, and bingo.
You can sort the table ascending or descending on all these things.
<p>
And see this table of the words:
<p class=ind>
<a target=_blank href='list/word-word-asc.html'>Words in the NYT Spelling Bee</a>
<p>
You will see word, length, frequency, and date the word first appeared.
You can sort the table ascending or descending on all these things.
<p>
If you scroll down on these pages you will see a link to
<span style="color: red">Load the entire file</span>.
This was done to make for faster loading of the top of the file
(which is likely what you are most interested in).

Another way to do Bee &#8220;research&#8221; is to search NYT Bee words
and Large Lexicon words for a pattern with this site:

<h2>Known Issues
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
This software is made by one person, not a team of NYT engineers.
It has limitations and weaknesses.  Here are the known issues:
<ul>
<li>The software was not designed for high volume.
If the usage becomes high the response time would suffer.
The software would need to be redesigned and possibly rewritten.
<li>Since you do not need to register and login (which is nice), your identity
is preserved in a &#8220;cookie&#8221; (aka website data)
within your web browser.  As long as you
don&#8217;t &#8220;clear your cookies&#8221; you will be fine.  Your identity within the program
is only truly important if you have added clues or created a community puzzle.
You can play the game regardless.
<p>
All browsers have a way
to clear the history <i>without</i> removing the website data.  For example,
on Safari holding the Option (aka Alt) key while clearing the history will
Keep Website Data.  If you inadvertently clear your cookie (i.e. your identity)
<script>abcd('send me an email');</script> with your name and location and
I can help restore the cookie.
<p>
Note that the <span class=cmd>ID</span> <a href=#power_id>Power User</a> command
is a way to restore your identity yourself.
<li>If two people using the same computer
want to play today's puzzle separately they
can use two different browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc) OR
simply reset the game with the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command.
They could also each reset their identity with the <span class=cmd>ID</span>
<a href=#power_id>Power User</a> command.
<li>There is some issue with copying to the clipboard on the
Safari browser.
<li>Finally, I know there are many unknown issues.  If you find them
please <script>abcd('let me know');</script>.

How many different <a href=#schemes>Color Schemes</a> are there?<p>
A <b>bit</b> is either 0 or 1 = <span class=red>2</span> states.<br>
A <b>byte</b> has <span class=red>8</span> bits giving 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 values from 0 to 255.<br>
A <b>color</b> is composed of <span class=red>3</span> bytes (red, green, blue) so there are 256<sup>3</sup> = 16,777,216 unique colors.<br>
A <b>color scheme</b> has a color for each of <span class=red>9</span> areas so there are 16,777,216<sup>9</sup> >= 10<sup>65</sup> different color schemes.<br>
<p>
Summarizing:<ul>
<span style='font-size: 34pt'>2<sup>8<sup>3<sup>9</sup></sup></sup></span> = 1.053122916686 * 10<sup>65</sup>, approximately.

This post in the HiveMind on August 14, 2023 shows that being able to click on words in the Puzzle, Donut, Lexicon, Bonus and Stash lists to get definitions of
words is a useful and desired thing:

The file /usr/share/dict/words on OSX is known as &#8220;the large lexicon&#8221;.
This collection of words contains 235,886 words of which 98,634 of them have a
length >= 4 and contain no more than 7 unique letters.
Surprisingly, it is missing many words - such as INTERNET! &#128540;
