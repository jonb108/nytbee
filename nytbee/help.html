<h2>Introduction</h2>
The New York Times has had the Spelling Bee
puzzle in the print version of the weekly New York Times Magazine since 2014.
The daily <a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>
web version</a> launched on May 9, 2018.
Wikipedia has links to several <a target=nytbee href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Spelling_Bee'>stories about the game</a>
and the vibrant community of people who enjoy it (the "HiveMind").
Many people play the game on their phone with the New York Times app.
<p>
Here is the NY Times version:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee1 href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee</a>
</ul>
Now there's <i>another</i> way to play:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee2 href='https://logicalpoetry.com/cgi-bin/nytbee.pl'>logicalpoetry.com/nytbee</a>
</ul>
This new enhanced alternate mechanism has several 
<a href=#advantages>advantages</a>.
<p>
There are several <a href=#videos>videos</a> to show how it works.
<p>
Give it a try and <script>abcd('let me know');</script> what you think.
<p>
My name is Jon Bjornstad.  I live in Davis, CA.  I am 73 years old.
I retired from the corporate software world a few years ago
but I still very much enjoy the art of programming.
In short, I am an old Perl hacker.
When I saw the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a> of the NYT Spelling Bee
and realized that it was <i>static</i>, that it did not change as
you found words, I immediately thought, "That's not right.  I can do better."
And I have.  The complete source code for this project is on

<h2>How to Play
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<ul style='margin-top: 8px'>
<img height=270 src=pics/df_honeycomb.png>
<li>Create words using the 7 letters.
<li>Words must contain at least 4 letters.
<li>Words must include the center letter.
<li>Letters can be used more than once.
<p>
<li>The list of allowed words does not include words
that are obscure, hyphenated, or proper nouns.
<li>No cussing either, sorry.
<p>
<li>Score points to increase your rating.
<li>4-letter words are worth 1 point each.
<li>Longer words earn 1 point per letter.
<li>Each puzzle includes at least one "pangram" which uses every letter. These are worth 7 extra points!
</ul>
The 'allowed list' is a finite list of words chosen by
the puzzle creator.  Your challenge is to find them all.
<p>
Finding <b>all</b> of the words is just one way to play.
There are other '<a href=#games>games within the game</a>' that are another
kind of fun challenge.
<a name=advantages></a>
<h2>Advantages
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The many advantages of this alternate way include:
<ul>
<li>The Hint Table and Two Letter List are <i>dynamic</i>.
<li>You can play the large archive of NYT puzzles.
<li>Dictionary definitions as hints - to enlarge and challenge your vocabulary.
<li>Get 'credit' for finding <a href='#donut'>donut, lexicon, and bonus</a> 
words.  You can also see how many extra words others have found.
This introduces a bit of fun Spelling Bee <a href=#competition>competition</a>!
<li>Create your <i>own</i> puzzle with clues and share it with the HiveMind.
<li>Clerical assistance in <a href=#clues>creating clues for NYT Puzzles</a> to post in the HiveMind Forum or on FaceBook.
Clues are shown with the <span class=cmd>D</span> command.
<li>No need to register or login.
<li>No subscription needed to play the full puzzle.
<li>4 different presentations of the 7 letters.
<li>Multiple puzzles at once - multi-tasking.
<li>Incremental revealing of letters.
<li>REplaying puzzles.
<li>Search the NYT puzzle archive and community puzzles for words.
<li>Find puzzles with the same 7 letters
(usually with a different center letter).
<li>An easy and clean 'dictionary browser'.
</ul>
<a name=screen_names></a>
<h2>Screen Names
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
There is no need to register or login to this game.
ALL are welcome.
There is a need, however, for <i>some</i> form of identification.
To address this need you will be assigned a random 'screen name'.
For fun, the randomly assigned name is composed of one of these Bee related words:
<ul>
Hive Bee Queen Worker Drone Honey Bumble Apian Buzz
</ul>
plus a random digit from 1 to 99.
<p>
You can change your screen name at any time
with the command <span class=cmd>SN</span> like
so:
<ul>
SN CHARLIE
</ul>
The screen name can be <i>anything</i> you wish.
Uniqueness is enforced.
The name is entered in ALL CAPS but is transformed like so:
<ul>
BEE_THE_ONE
</ul>
becomes:
<ul>
BeeTheOne
</ul>
<p>
Screen names are shown with the 
<span class=cmd>CW</span>
command which
shows the <a href=#competition>competition</a> for Extra Words.
<a name=words></a>
<h2>Words and Commands
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The new mechanism looks like this:
<p>
<img width=500 src=pics/new_look.png>
<p>
In the text field you enter words that satisfy the rules of the puzzle.
You can enter more than one word.  Press Return to see if the words are
acceptable.  Any error messages will appear above the text field.
Words you have found will appear below the text field in alphabetical order.
<p>
Pressing Return when the text field is empty will clear any messages.
If there are no messages to clear, the 6 outer letters will be permuted.
<p>
If you lose focus on the text field you can restore it by
hitting the Tab key.
<p>
<p>
At the top the <span class=blue>Help</span> link shows this document.
The <a target=_blank href=cmd_list.pdf>Cmds</a> link shows the <a target=_blank href=cmd_list.pdf>list of commands</a> you can enter in the text field.
Here are a few simple ones:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>I</span></td><td>Show <span class=cmd>I</span>nformation about the puzzle including numbers of words, points, pangrams, and (maybe) <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a>.
Note that a pangram is termed "perfect" if it is 7 letters long.
<p>If the puzzle was <a href=#create>created</a> by the HiveMind community details from the creator are given.
<p>
If <a href=#clues>clues have been added</a> for a puzzle the authors are listed.  Click on an author name to see all of their clues.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>R</span></td><td>Show the <span class=cmd>r</span>ankings - from Beginner to ... Amazing to Genius to Queen Bee.  It also shows how many points are needed to get to the next rank.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>W</span></td><td>Show the found words in the order they were found.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>SC</span></td><td>Show how the score was tallied and how many words remain to be found.  A thin line shows where you first asked for a hint.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>M</span></td><td>Show the latest Message of the Day.  These messages will be shown periodically to give tips, tricks, and other information.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>ST</span></td><td>Toggle the showing of puzzle <span class=cmd>st</span>atus: numeric or graphical. Default is numeric.<p>
The numeric status looks like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/nstatus.png height=90>
<p>
The graphical status looks like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/gstatus.png height=150>
<p>
b - bingo<br>
p - pangrams<br>
w - words<br>
s - score<br>
h - hints<br>
<p>
The bingo line will appear only if the puzzle is a <a href=#bingo>Bingo</a>.
If the number of hints exceeds the number of words
the line of dots will be truncated and a <span style="font-size: 23pt">+</span> will be appended.  If the hint count is negative the dots will be <span class=red1>red</span>.
<br><br></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>C&nbsp;&nbsp;Y</span></td><td>Clear the puzzle and start over. <span class=cmd>C&nbsp;&nbsp;Y</span> means Clear and confirm with Yes.</td></tr>

<h2>Playing on a Mobile Phone
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
While it is easiest to play on a computer with a keyboard
it is <i>also</i> easy to play on a mobile phone.  I have an iPhone and
using the Safari browser with the text enlarged (with the aA icon) to 150%
and holding the phone horizontally 
this is what the screen looks like:
<p>
<img src=pics/nytbee_iPhone.png width=800 border=1>
<p>
In this mobile mode the heading has been toggled off.
You have 5 command words to the right of the hexagon letters:
<span class=cmd>Enter</span>, <span class=cmd>Define</span>, <span class=cmd>Delete</span>, <span class=cmd>Help</span>, and <span class=cmd>Cmds</span>.
<p>
Tapping on letters will copy them to the area on the right:
<p>
<img src=pics/kitchen.png width=800 border=1>
<p>
Tapping on <span class=cmd>Delete</span> will remove letters.
Tap on <span class=cmd>Enter</span> to submit the word.
<p>
Tapping on <span class=cmd>Define</span> will do a DR command to define a random word
that has not yet been found.
<p>
Tapping on <span class=cmd>Help</span> will bring up this document in a separate browser window.  Tapping on <span class=cmd>Cmds</span> will show the <a target=_blank href=cmd_list.pdf>list of commands</a> you can enter into the text field.
<p>
If you wish to enter a command, see the list of found words,
or view the Hint Table simply scroll down.
<p>
Android phones will behave in a similar way.
<p>
If you are adept at texting with your thumbs you may prefer using the <span class=cmd>H3</span> command to display the letters in a line - like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/kitchen_h3.png width=800 border=1>
<a name=hint_commands></a>
<h2>Hint Commands
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
It is <i>not</i> easy to find <i>all</i> the words in a puzzle
and reach the stratospheric height of the Queen Bee rank.
Most of us mere mortals need kind of some help to get to Amazing or Genius.
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>HT</span></td><td>Show the Hint Table.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TL</span></td><td>Show the Two Letter List.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>The Hint Table and the Two Letter List are explained <a href=#table_list>below</a>.<p></td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DP</span></td><td>Define the Pangrams.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan=2><span class=cmd>D&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;word&gt;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Define the word.
You can ask for definitions of <i>any</i> word - not just the ones in the puzzle.
No hints are tallied.
This form of the <span class=cmd>D</span> command serves as a quick and fun way to browse a dictionary that is more pleasant somehow (less clutter and noise!) than a full web site.  You can give multiple words on the command line.
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
Definitions are from <a target=nytbee href='https://wordnik.com'>wordnik.com</a>.  These definitions are very brief because they're just a hint.  Complete definitions would cover multiple meanings and multiple parts of speech.  Once a word is found and shown in the Found Word List you can click on it again to see the brief definition.  Click on the brief definition to see the <i>complete</i> definition from wordnik.com in another window.
<p>
If there there is a <a href=#clues>clue</a> for a word it is shown
instead of the dictionary definition.

<h2>The Hint Table and the Two Letter List
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<p>
The <span class=green>Hint Table</span> (aka The Grid) (invoked with the <span class=cmd>HT</span> command) looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/hint_table.png>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>5</span> in the <b>M</b> row and the <b>6</b> column means that the the puzzle has <span class=blue>5</span> words beginning with <b>M</b> of length <b>6</b>.
<p>
The <span class=green>Two Letter List</span> (invoked with the <span class=cmd>TL</span> command) looks like this:
<ul>
<img src=pics/two_letter_list.png>
</ul>
The <span class=blue>GE-4</span> means that the puzzle has <b>4</b> words beginning with <b>GE</b>.
<p>
There are <span class=red>two important things</span> 
about the table and list.
<ol>
<li>They are <b><i>DYNAMIC</i></b>.  As you discover and enter words,
the numbers in the table and lists will <i>change</i>.
The numbers represent the number of words that <i>remain</i> to be found.
<li>You can <b>click</b> on the entries in the table and lists to
get definitions <i>and clues</i> for the words.
</ol>
<p>
The <a href=#power>Power User</a> command
<span class=cmd>CO</span> = COllapse
is a toggle to show or not show (collapse) the rows and columns
in the Hint Table that have no entries.  As you get closer to Queen Bee
it is fun to see the table shrink.
<hr width=500>
<p>
For those who work on the puzzle at nytimes.com or with
the NYT mobile app and would like the Table and List
to be dynamic there <i>is</i> a solution:
<ul>
<a target=nytbee href='https://logicalpoetry.com/bee'>logicalpoetry.com/bee</a>
</ul>
Select and Copy the words you have found, Paste them into the text field,
and hit Return.   The Table and List will show
<i>only</i> the missing words.  This applies, of course, only
to today's puzzle.   Duplicate, invalid, and stray words will be
silently ignored.
<p>You can actually do a Select All on the whole puzzle page!
Then the sequence is:
<ol>
<li>Find words in the puzzle
<li>Copy
<li>Switch to the Table/List window
<li>Paste
<li>Switch back
</ol>
<p>
<a name=hint></a>
<h2>Hint Strategy
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = Queen Bee <i>all by myself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
There are many ways to get hints and
each increases your 'hint total'.
The number of hints are tallied like so:
<p>
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Command</th><th align=left colspan=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;# hints</th></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>HT</span></td><td align=right>10</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>TL</span></td><td align=right>5</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D</span></td><td align=right>3</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>V,E</span></td><td align=right>2</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>1</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>2</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>DR</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D5</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>51</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>52</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>#, #B, #4, #&gt;4</span></td><td align=right>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>G&nbsp;Y</span></td><td align=right>5</td><td>for each word</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
Some people do not mind how many hints they need to achieve Queen Bee.
It <i>is</i> just a game and they feel that games should be fun. &#128521;
If I make it to the rank of Amazing all by myself I call it a very good day.
And some days I consider it a success
if the Hint total is less than the Score. &#128522;
<p>
Note that with enough hints you can <i>always</i> make it to Queen Bee.
For example, with the 5 letter word MAGMA you could ask
for the hints V4MA and E2MA to get all 5 of the letters.
<p>
<a name=hint_ratio></a>
Once the rank of Amazing is reached the ratio of hints
to total score is shown.  Here's an example of where I struggled
to get to Queen Bee after I got to Genius &#128549;:

<h2>Games within the Game
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Achieving "Queen Bee All By Myself" (QBABM) is the ultimate goal but
for most of us mere mortals it is rarely achieved.
There <i>are</i> other fun ways to play:
<ul>
<li>The Pangram Game - Get random games (with the command <span class=cmd>NR</span>) and find all of the pangrams.  The commands <span class=cmd>DP</span> and <span class=cmd>V1P</span> can help.  You can periodically clear
your list of games with the <span class=cmd>XA</span> command.
<li><a href=#gn4l>Genius No 4 Letter</a> (GN4L) - Find only 5+ letter words to reach the Genius level.  The commands <span class=cmd>51</span>, <span class=cmd>52</span>, and <span class=cmd>D5</span> can help.  You can also try for GOTN (On the Nose).
<li><a href=#bingo>Bingo</a> - Get random Bingo games (with the command <span class=cmd>NRB</span>) and try for the various levels of Bingo achievement.  The command <span class=cmd>BT</span> can help.
<li>Don't worry about your hint total and just keep asking for hints
(via the <span class=cmd>D</span>, <span class=cmd>V</span>, and <span class=cmd>E</span> commands) until you get to Queen Bee.   This is
still an accomplishment!  Using brief definitions to find words
is a way to challenge and enlarge your vocabulary.
<li>You could do <i>all</i> of the above
by resetting the puzzle between the games with the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command.
<li>Find all the words and get to Queen Bee however you want
and then reset the game (with <span class=cmd>C Y</span>) and see if you can
remember the words.  If you keep doing this your <a href=#hint_ratio>hint ratio</a> should get lower and lower.
<li>Find as many <a href='#donut'>Donut</a> words as you can.
There is, of course, no 'official' list of
these words but you can tell your friends about how many you found.
You can also search for Lexicon and Bonus words and get Hint Credits.
<li>A different kind of activity is to find all the words in today's puzzle
(however you wish, even with the <span class=cmd>G YP</span> command &#128522;) and
then add some clever inventive <a href=#clues>clues</a>.
This will help everyone else
who is playing the game with this software.  You can also copy and paste
your clues into the NYT Spelling Bee forum to help the larger world-wide HiveMind.
<li>Finally, you could <a href='#create'>create your own puzzle</a> and
give it as a gift to one of your friends.  Their name could be one of the pangrams - or one of the words in the allowed list! &#128525;
</ul>
<a name=bingo></a>
<h2>Bingo
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
If each of the 7 letters in a puzzle is the first letter of at
least one word in the
list of allowed words then this is called a "Bingo".
It is called "Bingo" in reference to the real <a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)'>Bingo</a> game where
you win if you complete a row, column, or diagonal.
Not all puzzles are Bingo puzzles but there are many.
In the first 1530 puzzles in the <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a>
650 were Bingo puzzles.
The <span class=cmd>I</span> command will tell you if a puzzle is a Bingo as
does the graphical status (see the command <span class=cmd>ST</span>).
When you enter a word that completes a Bingo you get a congratulatory message.
There are 4 levels of Bingo achievement:
<ul>
1 - YES, you achieved a BINGO! &#128077;<br>
2 - In the FIRST 7 words you found! &#128077; &#128077;<br>
3 - Even better, they were found in ALPHABETICAL order! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
4 - AND with a MINIMUM score! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;<br>
 or<br>
4 - AND with a MAXIMUM score! &#128077; &#128077; &#128077; &#128077;
</ul>
Trying to achieve these levels of Bingo are little games
within the game that some people enjoy.  It is much easier than QBABM!
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>BT</span> (Bingo Table) shows a subset of the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a>.  For each of the 7 letters it shows the <i>lengths</i> of the words with minimum and maximum <i>scores</i>.  This helps when you are aiming for level 4 Bingo.  For example (from 1/22/21):

Note that in this puzzle the word INCONVENIENCE (13) is longer than <span class=green>INCONVENIENT</span> (12) but the latter is a pangram.
<p>
As in the <a href=#table_list>Hint Table</a> the numbers in the BT table are <i>links</i> - to show a brief definition of the word(s). <span class=cmd>BT</span> is a toggle - the default is off.
If a puzzle is not a Bingo no table will be shown.
<p>

<h2>Genius No 4 Letter
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Another little game within the game is achieving the rank of Genius
without any 4 letter words.  The abbreviation for this in the HiveMind forum
is GN4L (Genius No 4 Letter).
<p>
Since 4 letter words are only valued at 1 point, attaining GN4L is almost always possible.
In the first 1530 games in the <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a> there were
only 8 games where GN4L was not possible.  It isn't easy, however,
and here are a few commands to help:
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>D5</span></td><td>Define a random word not yet found that has 5 or more letters.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>51</span></td><td>Show a random non-zero entry from the Hint Table where the length is 5 or more.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class=cmd>52</span></td><td>Show a random entry from the Two Letter List of words with a length of 5 or more.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
When you achieve GN4L you get a congratulatory message:
<ul>
Genius &#128077;&#128077;<br>
And you did it without ANY 4 letter words! &#128522;
</ul>
A minor (relatively easy) variation on GN4L is GOTN - Genius On the Nose.
This is where your point total is <i>exactly</i> at the beginning
of the Genius level.  Genius is 70% of the maximum point total (Queen Bee).
The <span class=cmd>R</span> command will tell you the exact score
for the Genius level.
GOTN requires that you achieve GN4L at the same time.  There is
this additional congratulatory message for GOTN:
<ul>
On the Nose! <span style='font-size: 24pt'>&#128067;</span> &#128522;
</ul>
As you get close to Genius you can consult the Hint Table to see if there is a 5+ letter word remaining that will get you to Genius exactly.  If not, you could <i>remove</i> a word with the <a href=#power>Power User</a> "minus" command - like this: <span class=red style='font-size: 25pt'>-</span>&lt;word&gt;.  This will adjust your score so you can then have other ways to make the score match the Genius level exactly.

<h2>Donut, Lexicon, and Bonus Words
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
<h3>Donut</h3>
While searching hunting foraging for words that are in the 'allowed list'
it often happens that you see a real word that does not contain the center
letter.  These words are called 'Donut Words' because the 6 non-center letters
form a circle (or torus) with a hole - like a donut or 
<a target=_blank href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut'>doughnut</a>.
This puzzle from May 27, 2022:
<p style="margin-left: .2in">
<img width=370 src=pics/donut.jpg>
</p>
had more than 50 (!) Donut Words including Again, Agar, Agrarian,
<span class=purple>Arming</span>,
<span class=green>Grammarian</span>,
and <span class=purple>Margin</span>.  Another Donut Word is 'Anagram'
which had never occurred in an NYT Spelling Bee before - how fun is that! &#128522;
Note that <span class=purple>Arming</span>, <span class=green>Grammarian</span>, and <span class=purple>Margin</span> are <i>pangram</i> donut words because
they use all 6 letters.  <span class=purple>Arming</span> and <span class=purple>Margin</span> are <i>perfect</i> pangram donut words because they are 6 letters long.  
<p>
Donut Words are deemed acceptable if they occur in the large lexicon
or have appeared before in an NYT Bee Puzzle.
<h3>Lexicon</h3>
Another type of word is one that IS a real valid actual proper qualified word
containing the center letter but which for some mysterious, arbitrary,
rational, or irrational reason was not included in the 'allowed list'.
In the above puzzle the words WAIN and WANG are such valid words that
were not included in the allowed list - because they are rare or obscure?
These disallowed words are the subject of many many repetitous and lengthy
discussions and debates in the HiveMind Forum.  One example is
the word URTICARIA - see 
<a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/crosswords/spelling-bee-forum.html#commentsContainer'>the forum for May 16, 2022</a>.
These words are called 'Lexicon Words' because they <b>are</b> to be found
in the large lexicon of words in /usr/share/dict/words on OSX.
This lexicon contains 235,886 words of which 98,634 of them have a
length >= 4 and contain no more than 7 unique letters.
<h3>Bonus</h3>
When seeking questing looking for words in the allowed list
how often have you muttered the phrase "<span class=green>If I only had an E...</span>"?
For this, there are <i>Bonus</i> words.  A Bonus word is at least 6
letters long, uses some of the 7 letters
(<i>not</i> necessarily including the center one),
and an <i>additional</i> letter that is <i>not</i> one of the 7.
<p>
In this puzzle from November 13, 2022:
<p style="margin-left: .4in">
<img src=pics/22-11-13.png width=300>
<p>
the words VICINIT<span class=red1>Y</span> and INCITE<span class=red1>M</span>ENT are Bonus words which use an additional Y and M respectively.
Bonus words must appear either in the large lexicon or in the list of previous
NYT Puzzle words.
A <span class=green>Bonus Pangram</span> is one that uses all 7 letters plus the extra one.
A <span class=purple>Perfect Bonus Pangram</span> is exactly 8 letters long.
The additional letter <i>can</i> be an <span class=red1 style="font-size: 20pt">S</span> (finally!).
<span class=red1>S</span>CIENCE is another Bonus word for the above puzzle. 
Note that very few plurals occur in the large lexicon and that
many words ending in ING and ED are absent as well.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>AL</span> command will show the 19 additional letters.
<p>
It seems that Bonus words are often more colorful and intriguing
than the typical boring "normal" words.
<p>
Searching for Bonus words on a mobile phone is somewhat awkward.
The additional letter is (of course!) not in the 7 displayed letters
so you need to enter the words in the text field.
The onscreen keyboard occupies a lot of the screen real estate.
The command <span class=cmd>BN</span> can help with this.
When it is toggled ON the display will look like this:
<p>
<img src=pics/teenage.png width=800 border=1>
<p>
The 19 (26-7=19) additional letters are put in a table.
Tap on them to append to the word.
<h3>Hint Credits</h3>
These three types of words (the term 'Extra Words' seems a good one) are
listed below the words you have found in the allowed list.  Like so:
<p style="margin-left: .2in">
<img src=pics/list3.png width=600>
<p>
You also get 'Hint Credits' by
adding a negative number to the Hint total:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>Donut</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Lexicon</td><td>-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bonus</td><td>-3</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
In the above puzzle we have:
<ul>
(5 * -1) + (3 * -2) + (7 * -3) = -32
</ul>
When the puzzle status is graphical negative hints are colored
in <span class=red1>red</span>.
<p>
Accumulating hint credits is like having money in the bank.
You can spend them wisely on 
definitions, reveals, and showing the
Hint Table and Two Letter List.
<p>
Finally, note that the minus command (hyphen, dash, '-') which is
used to remove words from the found list will add hints back if you
remove an Extra word.
<h3>Global Lists of Extra Words</h3>
There is, of course, no "official" list of these Extra words.
This makes it more fun, in a way.  More creative.
Here are 7 commands to show the Extra words found by the
<i>entire</i> global world-wide community.
You cannot use these commands on the same day of the puzzle; otherwise, people
could 'cheat' and use words found by others, yes?
The command <span class=cmd>Y</span> is convenient here to go
to yesterday's puzzle.
The words that <i>you</i> found are shown in
<span class=found_bonus>sky blue</span>.
<span class=green>Pangrams</span> and <span class=purple>Perfect Pangrams</span> are marked.
<p>
<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>DW</th><td>Show all Donut words in alphabetic order.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>LW</th><td>Show all Lexicon words in alphabetic order.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>BW</th><td>Show all Bonus words in alphabetic order.</td></tr>

<tr><th class='cmd rt'>NBW</th><td>Show all Bonus words in order of how many different people found them.</td></tr>
<tr><th class='cmd rt'>ABW</th><td>Show all Bonus words in order of the additional letter.  Within that additional letter the sort is by the number of people who found the word and then alphabetically. At the end are tallies of the number of words containing the center letter and also by length.</td></tr>
</table>
If you see a word you don't know you can click on it to see a brief definition
(and then go back in the browser to see the list again) and, as usual, click on the brief definition to see a complete definition at wordnik.com.
<p>
Note: These lists of words can change <i>after</i> the day of the puzzle.
Furthermore, as a "very big cheat" you could select, copy, and paste all of the words into the text box to add to your collection.

Extra words (Bonus, Donut, and Lexicon) for the current NYT puzzle.
The 'C' could also stand for Competitive &#128522;.
CW 10 will show the top 10.
Note that this command only shows the counts of words that were found <b>on</b>
the day the puzzle was released.  This command <i>can</i> be
entered throughout the day of the puzzle.   You can see how
you are doing with respect to everyone else.  This introduces
a fun competitive drive to try to find more and more words.</td></tr>

<h2>Clues for Puzzles
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Getting dictionary definitions for words with the
<span class=cmd>D</span> command
is nice &ndash; even though some people would consider it 'cheating' &#128521;.
Even more fun is to look at <b>clues</b> generously provided by
members of the HiveMind.  These clues are often humorous and clever
wordplay - as in crossword puzzle clues.  The word 'clue' is used here
instead of 'hint'.  These clues are much more creative and entertaining than
formal dictionary definitions or revealed letters.
<p>
You can write clues when you create a Community Puzzle as seen <a href=#create>below</a>.
You can <i>also</i> create clues for NYT Puzzles.
When the current puzzle is an NYT Puzzle choose the
<span class=blue>Add Clues</span> link
at the top.  There are several things to note:
<ul>
<li>Only the words you have found are shown.
<li>No need to give clues for <i>every</i> word.
<li>You can get dictionary definitions of the words to give
you some ideas.  Clicking on the words will give a brief definition.
Click on the brief definition to see the <i>complete</i> definition in another window.
<li>If you have given clues for a word before (such as for
frequently occuring words
like LOLL, NOON or TOOT) your clues will be offered and you can
cycle through them.
<li>If you want a multi-line clue put &lt;br&gt; at the end of lines.
<li>On Apple's OSX emojis can be inserted into clues with control-command-space.
</ul>
When you have finished with your clues they are all presented in a nice format.
In fact, there are 5 <i>different</i> nice formats in which to see your clues.
Choose your preferred format and then click on 'Ok'.  This will do two things:
<ol>
<li>Clear the format choices.
<li>Copy the clues onto the system clipboard.
</ol>
Then, if you wish, you can Paste your clues into the HiveMind Forum.
In this way your clues can benefit those
people who are playing Spelling Bee with the NYT app or
the standard NYT web application.
<p>
When <i>playing</i> an NYT Puzzle, if clues have been provided,
there will be a red asterisk <span class=red>*</span> after the date at the top.
<p>
Clues are shown when you use the <span class=cmd>D</span> command.
If there are clues from multiple authors they will be color-coded.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>I</span> (information) command will show the
names of people who submitted clues.
Clicking on an author's name will show the complete list of their clues.
Note that in this display,
if you've already found a word, that word is appended to the clue
and the whole line is in gray rather than black.  This helps you
focus on the clues for the words you have not yet found.
The tradition in the HiveMind Forum is that clues come in
the word alphabetical order and <i>can</i> have the length shown as well.
If you know this you have more information beyond the clue itself.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>CL</span> command will list the dates
of the NYT puzzles for which you have created clues. 
<p>
You can choose <span class=blue>Edit Clues</span> to update your clues.
If you leave all of the clue fields blank
your clue offering is effectively deleted.

<h2>Creating a Community Puzzle
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Why should Sam Ezersky be the only one to have the fun
(and responsibility) of puzzle creation?
<b>You</b> can create your <i>own</i> puzzle to share with the
HiveMind community.  To do so just click on the 'Create Puzzle' link
at the top of the main screen (right under 'Help').
You can also click on it here:
<a target=nytbee4 href='https://logicalpoetry.com/nytbee/mkpuz.html'>Create Puzzle</a>.
<p>
There are 5 steps to create a puzzle:
<style>
li {
    margin-bottom: 3mm;
}
</style>
<ol>
<li>Choose a 'pangramic' word - a word with exactly 7 unique characters.
This ensures that there will be at least one pangram in your puzzle.
In the NYT puzzles the letter S does not occur at all but
here you <i>are</i> allowed to have an S in your word.
You can also use E and R in the same puzzle, if you wish.
<p>
How to find a pangramic word?  There are five different ways:
<ol style='list-style-type: lower-alpha;'>
<li>On the page you will see links to 3 long
lists of pangramic words to choose from:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Pangrams from NYT Puzzles
<li>Pangramic words from a list of 10,000 common English words
<li>Pangramic words from a large lexicon
</ol>
These lists are disjoint.
<li>It is overwhelming to be confronted with such a large number
of word choices.  It's nice to be offered a smaller number.
On the page you'll see an <span class=rand>R5</span>
after the above 3 lists. They are links.
Clicking on them will show you 5 random pangramic words from that file.
Pressing Return will give you 5 more.
<li>If you have a word that you want to appear in the puzzle
you can search for pangramic words whose resulting puzzle
could have that word as part of the solution.    There is a second
text field for this purpose.
<p>
For example, the word '<span style="color: purple">enigma</span>' yields
'<span class=green>magazine</span>' from the NYT puzzles, '<span class=green>demanding examining messaging remaining</span>'
from the 10,000 word list, and 54 (!) words from the large lexicon - most
of which are too esoteric for a "reasonable" puzzle.
However &#128522; ... among those 54 I do see these that are quite reasonable:
<ul class=green>
<li>beaming
<li>egomania
<li>imagines
<li>maddening
<li>margarine
<li>menacing
<li>menagerie
<li>migraine
<li>mismanage
</ul>
<li>You can simply enter 7 unique letters and and see if there are any words in the lists that use those 7.  Try, for example, <span class=green>abclrne</span>.
<li>Let's say you have a friend named Bob Smith.  Notice that there are
exactly 7 unique letters in his name.  There are no pangramic words
in any of the above lists that use the letters 
<span class=green>bhimost</span> but we
can still proceed with making a puzzle for Bob.  Enter bobsmith
as the pangramic word and choose a center letter.
The "word" <span class=green>Bobsmith</span>
will be added to the "Other qualified" words and I'm sure you can
come up with a clever clue for Bobsmith that will make Bob Smith smile &#128522;.
</ol>
<li>Given your pangramic word, tallies are done of words, scores, 4 letter words, and pangrams by center letter.
Analyze these and choose a center letter.
<li>Choose which words to include in your puzzle.  This is the most
difficult part.  If you <i>don't</i> include a common word or <i>do</i>
include a very rare or esoteric word you may be subject
to questioning and possible derision. &#128521;
Surprisingly, there are many common ordinary words that have not yet been used
in any NYT Puzzle.
You do not need to include <i>all</i> common ordinary words.
This is your own custom personalized puzzle and you can make your own rules!
<li>Give clues for the words, if you wish.  See the <a href=#clues>previous section</a> for
more details on entering the clues.
<li>Lastly, give your name and location.  Optionally, you can give your
puzzle a title and description.  You also choose whether the puzzle is ready
to be "published" - made visible to the community.
</ol>
When these steps are complete your puzzle is assigned
a number and is immediately available to the community.
This number is used when giving the <span class=cmd>CP##</span> command.
CP here stands for Community Puzzle - a puzzle created by you for the HiveMind community!
<p>
A link will be displayed that looks like this:
<ul>
<span style="color: blue">https://logicalpoetry.com/cgi-bin/nytbee.pl/CP##</span>

where ## is your puzzle number.  This link can be shared.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>LCP</span> command lists the community puzzles.
<p>
The <span class=cmd>RCP</span> command lists puzzles that I <span class=cmd>r</span>ecommend because I find them interesting, clever, or an unusual challenge.
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>YCP</span> will list the community puzzles
that you have created.  You can click on the <span class=blue>CP##</span> link
to re-edit your puzzle.  You can update/change/delete the words and clues - but not the 7 letters or center letter.
You can also change the title and description.
<p>
The command <span class=cmd>XCP&lt;num&gt;</span> can be used to <i>delete</i> puzzles
that <i>you</i> have created.
<p>
The description of your puzzle can be used to inform
people why you made the puzzle and explain any guidelines for
what words might be included or excluded.  You can format
the description with these codings:
<ul>

This command also allows you to replicate your identity from one browser to another (e.g. Safari to Chrome or desktop browser to mobile browser).
<p>
The long string is computer generated and is guaranteed to be unique - but it
is long!  A much easier way to establish your identity is to create a string
that you know is (very likely) unique to you - like your name plus your birthday date. For
example:
<ul>
    <span class=cmd>ID</span> <span class=green>GERTIE4/30</span>

<h2>Other NYT Bee Projects
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The NY Times Spelling Bee concept has been a fertile source of challenge for
many clever software engineers.
<p>
<h4>Games You Can Play</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='https://swilliams.io/fun/hex/'>swilliams.io.fun/hex</a>
- A Javascript implementation.  Fast.  Clean code.
Uses a file of 1,500 pangramic words and a file of 10,000
common words.  A different puzzle each day.  No ranks.
No hint table.  Not NYT Puzzles so not 'curated'.  
Github repo is <a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/s-williams/Hexgame'>here</a>.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://freebee.fun'>freebee.fun</a>
is a free web version of the game that you can play!
Javascript and HTML/CSS.
It doesn't use NYT words so the word list is not 'curated'.
There is no hint table.
Source code in C is available for a command line version.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://github.com/philshem/open-spelling-bee'>Philip Shemella</a>
A command line game you can play written in Python.
Again, doesn't use NYT words.  It also generates new games.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://seanrayment.me/projects/nytimes-spelling-bee-clone/'>Cloning the NYT Bee</a> Written in node.js and other modern tools.  Only two games to play.  No hint table.  Choose 'live demo' at the bottom.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3qIxYZtqbw'>A sequence of 7 videos</a> The functionality of the NYT Spelling Bee is (sort of) replicated in Javascript/HTML/CSS.  The entire process is explained in great (<i>excruciating</i>) detail.
<h4>A Dynamic Hints Table</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='https://worker-bee.io'>worker-bee.io</a> A dynamic Hint Table in Javascript - pretty but somewhat
fragile as it doesn't have the full word list.
This site was very popular with the HiveMind.  On July 4, 2022 it was
shutdown because the developer (Karen Lao) had received a
cease-and-desist letter (email) from the New York Times.  The NYT claimed 
that she had violated their copyright, trademark, and intellectual property.
This raises all kinds of questions!
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://beesquared.ga'>beesquared.ga</a> Yet another dynamic Hint Table in Javascript.  They tried to address the issues that caused the NYT to shutdown worker-bee.io.   Time will tell what its (and this site's!) fate will be.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://spelling-bee-assistant.app/'>Spelling Bee Assistant</a> An extension for the Chrome browser that interacts with the NY Times Spelling Bee site.  Provides dynamic counts.  No hints or definitions.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='http://ljkrakauer.com/LJK/20s/spellingbee.htm'>Excel Spreadsheet for the Hints Table</a> This updates the hint table as words are found and pasted in.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://www.thegamebureau.com/beesheet'>Spelling Bee Hint Worksheet</a> A kind of spreadsheet you print out and, with a pen or pencil, fill in the words you have found.  This is further proof that there is an unmet need for the grid to be dynamic.
<p>
<a target=nytbee href='https://bumblewords.com'>bumblewords.com</a> A Javascript game.  Clean.  Not NYT Puzzles.  Cannot type - must click/tap.  It has a leaderboard.
<h4>Class Projects</h4>

<h4>NY Times Puzzle Answers</h4>
The 8 sites below show the list of allowed words in the
NY Times puzzle for each day.  In a variety of formats.
The intention is to help people solve the puzzle or, more accurately,
see what words they missed.  Most have annoying ads. &#128542;

<h4>Code <i>Stolen</i> from the NY Times &#128127; &#128561;</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes-spellingbee.com'>nytimes-spellingbee.com</a> You can play it.  The interface is nearly <i>identical</i> to the NY Times - but no hint table.
It is even "branded" with the NYT logo.  What?
Yikes!  They <b>stole</b> the Javascript/CSS/HTML from nytimes.com and embedded
it in an iframe.  How did they get around the need to subscribe?
Clever, but evil somehow.
<h4>NY Times Engineering Director</h4>
<a target=nytbee href='nyt_engineering_director.pdf'>This page</a> is a December 9, 2021 advertisement for a job at the NY Times as Director of Engineering for the Games team - to manage 30 engineers!

<h2>Without a Subscription?
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
Is it illegal or unethical to play the NYT Spelling Bee puzzles without a subscription?
<p>
I <b>do</b> have a <a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/subscription'>subscription</a> to the Times.  It is a reliable,
trusted, and curated source of information in these troubled times.
<a target=_blank href='https://www.nytimes.com/subscription'>Subscriptions</a>
help the many journalists stay focused on their story.
<p>
When the puzzle page is loaded into the web browser
the list of allowed words
<i>is</i> visible &ndash; if you know where to look.
This is what you will see in the HTML/Javascript page source:
<pre>
window.gameData = {
    "today": {
    "expiration": 1638345600,
    "displayWeekday": "Tuesday",
    "displayDate": "November 30, 2021",
    "printDate": "2021/11/30",
    "centerLetter": "h",
    "outerLetters": ["d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "validLetters": ["h", "d", "g", "i", "n", "o", "t"],
    "pangrams": ["goodnight", "hotdogging"],
    "answers": ["goodnight", "hotdogging", "dhoti", "doth",
        "godhood", "goth", "hiding", "high", "hind",
        "hinging", "hint", "hinting", "hitting", "hogging",
        "honing", "hood", "hooding", "hoodoo", "hoot",
        "hooting", "hotdog", "nigh", "night", "ninth",
        "nothing", "thigh", "thin", "thing", "thinning",
        "thong", "tight", "tithing", "tonight", "tooth"],
...
</pre>
So the words in the puzzle <i>are</i> available publicly each day.
The new mechanism I created is simply an alternate way
of using these words.

<h2>Same 7 Letters
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
In the large NYT Spelling Bee <a href=#nyt_archive>archive</a> there are many puzzles that share the
same set of 7 letters and hence the same pangrams.   
For example, there are 3 that
have occurred on 5 different dates:
<ul>
<table cellpadding=5 border=0>
<tr><td class='green bold'>ADFLMPU</td><td>06/26/18</td><td>10/28/19</td><td>03/07/20</td><td>06/06/20</td><td>07/02/20</td></tr>
<tr><td class='green bold'>BILMOTY</td><td>07/20/18</td><td>10/27/19</td><td>06/04/20</td><td>12/01/20</td><td>07/09/21</td></tr>
<tr><td class='green bold'>GNORTUW</td><td>08/17/18</td><td>05/02/19</td><td>12/16/19</td><td>03/20/20</td><td>02/04/21</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<table cellpadding=4>
<tr>
<th class=rt># 7 letter<br>sets</th>
<th class=rt># of<br>dates</th>
</tr>
<tr><td class=rt>3</td><td class=rt>5</td></tr>
<tr><td class=rt>35</td><td class=rt>4</td></tr>
<tr><td class=rt>97</td><td class=rt>3</td></tr>
<tr><td class=rt>184</td><td class=rt>2</td></tr>
</table>
</ul>
<p>
The <span class=cmd>F</span> command finds other dates that use the
same 7 letters as in the current puzzle.
These other puzzles usually (but not always)
have a different center letter.
Note these identical puzzles: 08/03/19 and 08/24/20.
<p>
<a name=nyt_archive></a>
<h2>NYT Archival Puzzles
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
The archive was gathered mostly from
<a target=nytbee href=https://nytbee.com>nytbee.com</a>.
It is now added to daily at 3:00 a.m. EST by extracting the words
from the New York Times site.  There are daily puzzles going all the way
back to May 9, 2018.   There are now
<!-- Do NOT mess with the next two lines - see cgi-bin/nytbee_list.pl! -->
1704 puzzles with
a total of 9265 different words!
<p>
Which puzzles from the large archive to play?
You can get one at random with the <span class=cmd>NR</span> command or you could
choose one with various attributes like ones with the most points or the
fewest 4 letter words.
<p>
Starting an archival puzzle is simple.
Just enter the puzzle date (like 12/16/21)
in the text field where you would enter a word.
<p>
To facilitate your curiousity and research
you can see <a target=_blank href=list/nyt_puzzles.txt>this text file</a>
of the many puzzles.  The lines have this format:
<p>
<pre class=ind>
yyyymmdd => seven center pangrams ... | words ...
</pre>
For example:
<p>
<pre class=ind>
20180524 => abceklm k camelback clambake | aback alack ... meek
</pre>
Tallies are made of the many puzzles and words.
See this table of the puzzles:
<p class=ind>
<a target=_blank href='list/puzzle-date-asc.html'>NYT Spelling Bee Puzzles</a>
<p>
You will see date, 
center letter, # words, # pangrams, score, # four letter words, and bingo.
You can sort the table ascending or descending on all these things.
<p>
And see this table of the words:
<p class=ind>
<a target=_blank href='list/word-word-asc.html'>Words in the NYT Spelling Bee</a>
<p>
You will see word, length, frequency, and date the word first appeared.
You can sort the table ascending or descending on all these things.
<p>
If you scroll down on these pages you will see a link to
<span style="color: red">Load the entire file</span>.
This was done to make for faster loading of the top of the file
(which is likely what you are most interested in).
<p>
Another way to do Bee "research" is to search NYT Bee words
and Large Lexicon words for a pattern with this site:
<ul>

<h2>Known Issues
<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=25></a>
</h2>
This software is made by one person, not a team of NYT engineers.
It has limitations and weaknesses.  Here are the known issues:
<ul>
<li>The software was not designed for high volume.
If the usage becomes high the response time would suffer.
The software would need to be redesigned and possibly rewritten.
<li>There is no forum for discussion about this new mechanism.
The NYT HiveMind Forum or a FaceBook group page could serve this purpose.
<li>Since you do not need to register and login (which is nice), your identity
is preserved in a 'cookie' (aka website data)
within your web browser.  As long as you
don't 'clear your cookies' you will be fine.  Your identity within the program
is only truly important if you have added clues or created a community puzzle.
You can play the game regardless.
<p>
All browsers have a way
to clear the history <i>without</i> removing the website data.  For example,
on Safari holding the Option (aka Alt) key while clearing the history will
Keep Website Data.  If you inadvertently clear your cookie (i.e. your identity)
<script>abcd('send me an email');</script> with your name and location and
I can help restore the cookie.
<p>
Note that the <span class=cmd>ID</span> <a href=#power>Power User</a> command
is a way to restore your identity yourself.
<li>If two people using the same computer
want to play today's puzzle separately they
can use two different browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc) OR
simply reset the game with the <span class=cmd>C Y</span> command.
They could also each reset their identity with the <span class=cmd>ID</span>
<a href=#power>Power User</a> command.
<li>There is some issue with copying to the clipboard on the
Safari browser.
<li>Finally, I know there are many unknown issues.  If you find them
please <script>abcd('let me know');</script>.
</ul>
