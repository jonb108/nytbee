<h2>Introduction</h2>
The New York Times has had the Spelling Bee
puzzle in the print version of the weekly New York Times Magazine since 2014.
The daily <a target=nytbee href='https://nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee'>
web version</a> launched on May 9, 2018.
Wikipedia has links to several <a target=nytbee href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Spelling_Bee'>stories about the game</a>
and the vibrant community of people who enjoy it.
Many people play the game on their phone with the New York Times app.
<p>
Now there's another way to play - on the <span class=cl><i>command line</i></span>.
<p>
Here is a <a target=nytbee href='https://youtu.be/PsWUQJXFb1s'>short film</a> that shows how it works.
There are several <a href=#advantages>advantages</a> to playing on the command line.   
Give it a try and <a href='mailto:Jon Bjornstad <jon.bjornstad@gmail.com>?subject=NYT Bee on the Command Line'>let me know</a> what you think.
<h2>How to Play</h2>

<h2>Advantages of the Command Line</h2>
<ul>
<li>The table of hints is <u>dynamic</u> &ndash; it updates as you find words.
It's also easier to access the table.

without revealing them.
This is a fun way to challenge and enlarge your vocabulary.
<li>Letters in the words can be slowly revealed giving
another way to get hints.
<li>You can play puzzles from the large NY Times <a href=#archive>archive</a>.
You can play forever (and do nothing else &#128522;).
<li>You can play many puzzles and switch between them.
<li>You are shown how many points you need to get to the next level.
<li>You can clear a puzzle and play it again for practice.
<li>You can play when offline - Airplane mode.
<li>You can solve the full puzzle without a subscription to the Times.
<li>There is a Pangram Mode where you only look for pangrams.
<li>It is driven completely from the keyboard so is fast.
</ul>
<h2>Download and Install and Start</h2>

<h2>Commands</h2>
In addition to entering words that you have found
there are also many single letter commands.  Some commands

</pre>

<h2>Assist Strategy</h2>
Many people who solve the puzzle try to use as few hints (aka assists)
as possible.
The ultimate is to achieve QBABM = Queen Bee <i>all by myself</i>.
This is possible but rather difficult.
In this command line version there are many ways to get hints but
with each hint your 'assist total' is increased.
The number of assists are tallied like so:
<ul>
<pre>
<span class=black>Command   # of assists</span>
<span class=cmd>t</span>        15 but just once
<span class=cmd>t1</span>       10 but just once
<span class=cmd>t2</span>        5 but just once
<span class=cmd>d,D,v,e</span>   1 for each word
<span class=cmd>1</span>         1
<span class=cmd>2</span>         1
<span class=cmd>g</span>       100
</pre>
</ul>
<a name=pangram_mode></a>
<h2>Pangram Mode</h2>
The command <span class=cmd>P</span> puts you into "pangram mode" where you search
<i>only</i> for pangrams.  There are different commands in this mode:
<ul>
<pre>
<span class=cmd>h</span>    Show this help
<span class=cmd>p</span>    Permute the 7 letters
<span class=cmd>d</span>    Define the pangram(s)
<span class=cmd>v</span>    Reveal another letter
<span class=cmd>e</span>    Reveal another beginning and Ending letter
<span class=cmd>g</span>    Give up and show the pangram(s)
<span class=cmd>q</span>    Quit and return to Spelling Bee mode
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
The pangrams are chosen at random from a list of more than 1700 words
that have exactly 7 unique letters in them.
The list was derived from pangrams occuring in the NYT Bee puzzles
plus a large lexicon of commonly used words in which the letter S is allowed.
<p>
Note: There may be multiple pangrams for a given set of 7 letters.
However, not all valid pangrams are necessarily included.  For example,
ACELORT has electoral but not correllate or reallocate.
<h2>The Timestamped Log</h2>
The <span class=cmd>lg</span> command shows a timestamped log of
your activities in the puzzle.  As you reach each new level it shows
the total elapsed time in seconds and how many assists you had.
It records when you pause and resume the puzzle.  For example:
<ul>
<pre>
10:26 start
math
mirth
*Good Start* 0:33 with 0 assists
trim
*Moving Up* 0:35 with 0 assists
charm
*Good* 0:37 with 0 assists
mama
mamma
mart
*Solid* 0:47 with 0 assists
cram
tram
mitt
10:28 pause
11:05 resume
march
mimic
mahimahi
*Nice* 1:05 with 13 assists
mahatma
mariachi
matriarch*
*Amazing* 2:49 with 21 assists
...
</pre>
</ul>
The lines are shown 25 at at time.  At the ... prompt
you can hit Return to go on to the next page or type q to quit.
Each puzzle has its own log.  The <span class=cmd>lga</span> command shows the log
including the assists that were requested.
