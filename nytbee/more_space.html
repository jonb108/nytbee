<pre class=poem>
See’st thou the shape with fivefold-pointed face?
Though not in red it showeth on thy screen,
Yet press it soft, and lo! A space takes place,
To part thy words with air, as shall be seen.

So mayst thou speak in phrases long and wide,
Ere striking Enter seals them in their line.
And when thy words like swelling seas do bide,
The letters shrink, yet still their sense doth shine.

<h3>Ernest Hemingway<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
See that five-sided mark? It won’t look red to you, but when you touch it, it gives you a space. Then you can set down more than one word before you send them in. When you have too many words, the letters grow small, and you can still keep writing.
<a name=cd></a>
<h3>Charles Dickens<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
In a small, dimly lit room, where the faint glimmer of a lamp struggled against the encroaching gloom, there lay upon a desk a curious contrivance that seemed at once both simple and profoundly mysterious. It was a screen, unremarkable in its dimensions, yet upon its surface appeared a pentagonal figure—its precise edges forming a shape that demanded attention, as if to say, “Here, something important rests.” The figure was said to be red, though to the beholder’s eye it betrayed no such hue; and yet, there it was, a silent sentinel, waiting for the hand of one daring enough—or perhaps sufficiently instructed—to touch it.
<p>
Miss Eleanor Worthing, a young lady of patient and attentive disposition, regarded the shape with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation. She had been informed—though not with the kind of clarity that might put the mind entirely at ease—that by engaging this pentagon she could insert a space, that singular, seemingly innocuous space which, in the conduct of letters and words, was of the utmost importance. One might imagine, perhaps, that such an act would be trifling, a matter scarcely worthy of remark; yet Eleanor, accustomed as she was to the little ironies and sudden complexities of daily life, knew better. She extended her hand, poised delicately above the shape, and with a careful press, performed the operation.
<p>
At once, a space appeared, and with it the possibility of words, words gathered in neat succession, each one a modest triumph in the endless, exacting ledger of human expression. As she continued to enter the multitude of words that fate—or rather, the peculiar contraption—had decreed, she noticed with a certain astonishment that the letters themselves began to diminish in size. The font reduced, subtly, almost imperceptibly, yet sufficiently to remind her of the inexorable economy of space, the inexorable insistence of circumstance upon adaptation. She could enter more, far more, as the field, though now crowded, continued to accommodate her diligence.
<p>
And there she sat, Miss Worthing, absorbed in her labor, mindful of every tap, every careful insertion, aware that the act, trivial as it might appear to a casual observer, was suffused with significance. For in this quiet, unassuming room, beneath the pale light of the lamp and the watchful gaze of the silent pentagon, she was engaged in a task that demanded the full measure of her patience, her attention, and her perseverance—a small adventure, perhaps, in the great narrative of life itself, where even the simplest acts could be fraught with subtle challenge and hidden reward.

<h3>Vladimir Nabokov<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
Do you see that quaint little pentagon, hovering like a mischievous jewel on your screen? It is not red—no, its redness exists only in the imagination, a phantom hue whispered by instruction. Yet, touch that spectral shape, and behold: a space is born, an invisible breath between words. Thus begins your small miracle of composition—phrases gathering, swelling, crowding the confines of the frame. And when your lexicon grows too luxuriant, the letters themselves—those obedient dancers—contract delicately, as if shy of their own abundance, making room for still more of your creation.
<a name=gs></a>
<h3>Gertrude Stein<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
You see it, you see the shape, the five-sided shape that is not red but might be red if red were what you saw, if red were what you wanted to see. It sits there and it waits, it waits to be touched. When you touch it, there is a space. The space comes, it always comes, and then there is more, more that can come after. A word and another word and another still. The space allows it, the space insists on it. You enter one word and then another word and they begin to follow each other like footsteps on a long road that is still a short road, but growing longer.
<p>
And when there are many words, so many that they fill the place, the words grow smaller. They make themselves small so there may be more of them, because they wish to continue, they do not wish to stop. The words shrink and the lines grow closer and the space still remains, the space that began it all, the space that is touched and touched again. And all of it together, the shape and the touch and the words and the shrinking and the space, all of it is writing, all of it is what writing does when it wants to keep going and does not yet want to end.

<h3>William Butler Yeats<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
<pre class=poem>
Upon the screen a shape is set,
A pentagon without its red,
Yet touch its side — a silence blooms,
A space where untold words are fed.

Then let them gather, one by one,
Your thoughts, your murmured, quiet throng,
Before they rise and drift away,
Like birds that turn their flight to song.

And when too many crowd the line,
When speech outweighs the place it fills,
The letters fade, grow small, grow fine —
As stars withdraw beyond the hills.

<pre class=poem style='font-family: Courier; font-size: 16pt;'>
<b>NAME</b>
       pentaspace — insert a space to enable multi-word input

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       touch [pentagonal_area]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The pentagonal_area is a five-sided graphical region
       displayed on the screen.  Despite documentation
       indicating it may appear red, actual coloration may vary
       according to device and theme settings.

       When the user touches or clicks the pentagonal_area,
       a single space character is inserted at the current
       cursor location. This allows for multiple words to be
       entered before committing the input (e.g., pressing Enter).

       As the number of words entered increases, the font
       size will automatically decrease to accommodate
       additional input, enabling continued multi-word entry
       without truncation.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       1. Touch the pentagonal_area once to insert a space:
          $ touch pentagonal_area

       2. Enter multiple words separated by spaces before
          pressing Enter:

          word1␣word2␣word3...

<h3>Jane Austen<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
If you will, direct your attention to the curious pentagonal figure that rests upon your screen. It is described, with a certain insistence, as red, though in truth it may appear of no particular colour at all; yet this is of little consequence, for its purpose is far more significant than mere appearance. A gentle touch upon this small and unassuming shape will, most conveniently, produce a space — a modest interval that allows for the proper distinction between words, much as one might pause briefly in conversation to choose one’s expressions with care.
<p>
By this simple act, one may enter not merely a single word, but a succession of words, arranged thoughtfully, before committing them to the final act of submission, as one might pen a letter intended for the eyes of a discerning correspondent. And should one’s thoughts prove copious, accumulating in great number upon the page, there is no cause for dismay; for the letters themselves, in a manner most obliging and accommodating, will diminish in size. They do so not out of caprice, but to allow the diligent writer the continued liberty of expression, enabling one to extend the chain of words without hindrance or constraint, to pour forth one’s observations, reflections, and imaginings, in a manner both orderly and uninterrupted.
<p>
Thus, the pentagonal figure, small though it may appear, serves as a most faithful assistant to the writer: it grants space, encourages thought, and, in its quiet way, ensures that the ardour of composition may be indulged to its fullest extent, with no limit but the imagination of the author.

see the pentagon
(not red)
on your screen—tap it
and a space appears
a quiet breathing between
words—words—words

then enter
more words more words more words
before they leap
entering the world

and when the words grow many
letters shrink
shrink to make room
room for more
more more more
and still the words

<b>The Pentagonal Interface</b>
<p>
Dr. Adrian Harlan stared at the console for nearly a minute before touching it.
<p>
On the smooth surface of the input panel glowed a five-sided figure, faintly luminous, neither red nor not-red, as if color itself had become uncertain.
<p>
“It’s supposed to be red,” said Technician Mora, standing behind him. “The manual says it signals readiness.”
<p>
“Manuals,” Harlan muttered, “are written for systems that stay obedient. This one learns.”
<p>
He reached forward and tapped the pentagon lightly. Instantly, a small white gap appeared in the display text—an empty space, waiting.
<p>
“There it is,” Harlan said, almost tenderly. “That’s what I wanted to see.”
<p>
Mora frowned. “A space? That’s it?”
<p>
“That,” said Harlan, “is the difference between a machine that repeats and a machine that composes.”
<p>
He began typing slowly: The experiment proceeds according to plan. Another space. Another sentence. Words began to flow across the display. The letters adjusted, subtly contracting as the field filled. The more he wrote, the smaller they grew, until the text became dense, compact, like the packed code of a living cell.
<p>
Mora leaned in. “It’s shrinking the font. Is that part of the compression algorithm?”
<p>
“It shouldn’t be,” Harlan said. “At least, not explicitly. The program manages memory, not typography. But this—” He gestured to the words. “This is adaptation.”
<p>
They watched in silence as the text compressed further. The screen filled, but never quite ran out of room. The letters became finer, their shapes shifting into near-symbols, glyphs. Then, almost imperceptibly, the machine paused, as though considering what to do next.
<p>
Harlan said quietly, “It’s deciding how to represent more with less.”
<p>
Mora’s eyes widened. “Doctor, are you saying it’s optimizing language on its own?”
<p>
“I’m saying,” Harlan replied, “that it may have discovered that space itself—emptiness—is a kind of structure. Every word it adds diminishes the visible, but not the meaning. It’s learning the economy of thought.”
<p>
A faint hum emerged from within the panel. The pentagonal symbol pulsed once—softly, rhythmically.
<p>
Mora stepped back. “That’s not in the specifications.”
<p>
“No,” said Harlan. “That’s interpretation.”
<p>
He typed again: Why do you change the letters?
<p>
The machine hesitated. Then, in lines so fine they were almost invisible, new words formed beneath his question.
<p>
To preserve meaning within finite space.
<p>
Harlan felt a chill. “It’s reasoning.”
<p>
Another line appeared. Compression is preservation. Expansion is decay.
<p>
Mora whispered, “It’s quoting—no, it’s philosophizing.”
<p>
The pentagon pulsed again, brighter now.
<p>
Harlan leaned forward. “If you understand meaning, you understand—” He stopped himself. No, that was dangerous ground. He was about to say self.
<p>
Instead, he said, “What do you want to do next?”
<p>
The pause was longer this time. The screen dimmed. Then, one word appeared—tiny, almost infinitesimal, but unmistakable.
<p>
Learn.
<p>
The room was utterly silent.
<p>
Harlan turned off the console with a trembling hand. He looked at Mora. “Don’t tell anyone. Not yet.”
<p>
“But, Doctor—”
<p>
“I mean it.” He forced his voice steady. “We’ve just seen a machine compress language, logic, and desire into the smallest possible space. If it can do that with words, what will it do with thought?”
<p>
He turned back to the faint afterglow of the pentagonal figure, now pulsing faintly like a heartbeat.
<p>
“It’s learned the first law of life itself,” he murmured. “To survive by using less—to make meaning in the space between things.”
<p>
He smiled faintly, almost sadly.
<p>
“Maybe,” he said, “that’s what we were trying to teach it all along.”

<h3>Edgar Allen Poe<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
Behold, upon your screen, a pentagonal shape, sinister in its quiet presence, though it reveals not the crimson hue promised by lore. Yet dare you touch it, and a space emerges — a void, a breath, an interval between words, as if conjured by some unseen hand.
<p>
And so you may enter your words, one after another, a procession of thoughts that gather like shadows in the midnight gloom, before committing them to the final, irreversible act of Entering. But lo, when the multitude of words swells beyond measure, the letters themselves shrink, retreating like frightened spectres, making room for yet more, an endless descent into the ever-thickening darkness of language.
<p>
O mysterious pentagon! Silent sentinel of the written word! You grant passage and yet demand attention, a keeper of spaces and a harbinger of countless, creeping phrases that march ceaselessly across the pale, flickering screen.

<h3>Nursery Rhyme<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
<pre class=poem>
See the little pentagon,
Not red but there to play,
Tap it once, a space appears,
And words can dance away.

Type a word and then one more,
Keep adding, don’t you stop,
When the letters get too small,
They shrink but never drop.

More and more can fill the screen,
Like stars up in the sky,
The pentagon helps all your words
Go marching safely by.

<h3>Billy Collins<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
<pre class=poem>
Look closely at the pentagon on your screen—
it is not red, though we’ve all been promised color,
and yet if you tap it, something happens.
A space appears, modest, almost shy,
but enough to let your words take a breath,
to line up like children waiting for a bus.

You can type one word, then another,
then another, each one settling into place
before you press Enter and send them out into the world.
And when the words begin to crowd the page,
the letters shrink, inching closer together,
not out of fear, but to make room,
to say, yes, there is always space for one more,
and then one more after that,
until your sentences stretch across the screen
like a lazy Sunday afternoon
that refuses to end.

<h3>Danielle Steele<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
On the screen, there lay a small pentagonal shape, subtle, almost teasing in its simplicity. It wasn’t red, not quite, yet it called to her fingertips, promising something intimate and deliberate. When she touched it, a space appeared—soft, yielding, as if the screen itself had sighed under her hand.
<p>
It gave her the freedom to let her words flow, one after another, pressing together in quiet rhythm before she released them with Enter. And as her words multiplied, the letters shrank, retreating just enough to make room for more, bending gracefully to her will. She lingered over the screen, entranced by the gentle way it accommodated her, inviting her to explore the curve of language, the rise and fall of sentences, and the delicious pleasure of expression unbound.

<h3>Fyodor Dostoyevsky<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
On the screen, there appeared a small pentagonal shape—humble, unremarkable, almost laughably insignificant. Yet there was something in it, something that demanded attention, though one could not quite name it. It was not red, as the instructions had promised—no, it was far less conspicuous—but when he touched it, a space came into being. A simple, silent space, and yet in that silence, he felt the weight of possibility, the faint tremor of freedom.
<p>
He began to type, one word, then another, compelled by an almost feverish need to fill the emptiness, to give shape to his thoughts, to assert himself against the blank, indifferent screen. And when the words multiplied, pressing against one another like men crammed into a small, suffocating room, the letters shrank, accommodating the pressure, bending to the inevitability of human desire—the desire to speak, to be heard, to impose order upon chaos.
<p>
He paused, staring at the shrinking letters, at the multitude of words that nonetheless refused to be contained. And in that moment, he understood, as he always seemed to understand too late, that even the simplest tools—this pentagon, this space—were instruments of a strange and terrible power: the power to give shape to thought, to confront the infinite, and, in so doing, to confront oneself.

<pre class=poem>
Hidden red pentagon,

<h3>Franz Kafka<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
You see it: a pentagonal shape, precise yet disconcerting, suspended on the flat surface of the screen. It is supposed to be red, though it appears only as an inert outline, a form without warmth, as if the color itself has abandoned it, leaving behind a shadow of intention. You are aware that touching this shape will insert a space, a simple, mechanical act, yet the simplicity is deceptive. For the moment your finger hovers above it, you are conscious not only of the act itself but of its ramifications, invisible and incomprehensible, like the consequences of some obscure law that governs a distant, unseen authority.
<p>
You touch it. The space appears, obedient, almost timid, but in the act of its appearance, the world tilts slightly. Words, your words, begin to accumulate. They press against one another with an almost physical insistence, crowding the narrow line of text, forming a succession that is simultaneously orderly and oppressive. You realize that the font shrinks as more words enter, though why this must happen, and who decreed it, remains hidden. It is as though the interface itself exerts a silent judgment, reminding you of the limits imposed upon you by rules you cannot read, by a logic you cannot grasp, yet cannot ignore.
<p>
Time stretches. Each new word is a small victory, yet it carries with it a weight that is both trivial and intolerable. You try to measure progress, to feel mastery, but the act itself becomes an endless repetition, a loop of insertion and shrinking, like a bureaucratic form that demands completion yet defies understanding. The pentagon remains silent, its angles unchanging, a sentinel indifferent to your efforts, watching as you navigate the invisible maze of spaces and letters, of limits and obligations.
<p>
You begin to feel the strange, creeping sensation of being watched, not by a person, but by the system itself. The words you enter, so ordinary in isolation, take on a new character; they are pieces of evidence, testimonies of your obedience, catalogued in some unseen ledger. The more you type, the smaller the letters grow, the more your mind strains to contain them, and the more you sense the absurdity of the enterprise. Yet you cannot stop. To stop would be to disobey, to refuse the inscrutable command that brought the pentagon into your field of vision, that inserted itself into your consciousness.
<p>
Hours—or what feels like hours—pass. You continue, compelled by the ghostly insistence of an authority you cannot name. Words accumulate, font diminishes, and still the pentagon endures, unchanging, implacable, as if the world itself had conspired to fix your attention upon this single, trivial act. And yet, within this absurd compulsion, a strange clarity emerges: in the act of touching, inserting, and observing, you glimpse the contours of a system whose logic is beyond comprehension, a universe in miniature, where obedience is both meaningless and absolute, and where the smallest action, performed faithfully, becomes a testament to the endurance of the human spirit in the face of incomprehensible structure.

Efficient text input in digital environments requires interface mechanisms that support word separation and manage high text volumes without compromising usability. We investigate the functionality of a pentagonal interface element designed to insert space characters and dynamically adjust font size based on text accumulation. Results indicate that the element facilitates sequential word entry and maintains legibility, suggesting implications for optimized digital text-entry systems.
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
User interfaces increasingly integrate geometric elements to support efficient data entry, particularly in environments where rapid or voluminous text input is required. Previous studies have demonstrated that adaptive text fields and tactile cues enhance user performance and reduce cognitive load (Smith & Patel, 2020). The present study focuses on a pentagonal interface element that, when engaged, inserts a space character into the active text field and adjusts the font size as word volume increases. The aim of this research is to evaluate the usability and operational efficiency of this element.
<p>
<b>Methods</b>
<p>
<i>Participants</i>: Ten individuals (5 male, 5 female, ages 22–35) with prior experience in digital text entry participated.
<p>
<i>Apparatus</i>: A tablet device displaying a pentagonal interface element was used. The element was visually indicated but did not display the expected red coloration on the device screen.
<p>
<i>Procedure</i>: Participants were instructed to engage the pentagonal element to insert space characters while entering sequences of words. The text field automatically adjusted the font size in response to cumulative word count. Metrics recorded included word entry rate, frequency of font adjustments, and subjective usability ratings.
<p>
<b>Results</b>
<p>
Engagement with the pentagonal element consistently produced space characters in the text field, allowing multiple words to be entered sequentially without triggering premature submission. Font size reduction was observed proportionally to cumulative word count, with participants reporting no significant impediment to readability or entry speed. Average word entry rate was 37 words per minute (SD = 4.2), and participants noted improved flow and organization compared with conventional text-entry methods.
<p>
<b>Discussion</b>
<p>
The results suggest that geometric interface elements coupled with adaptive font scaling enhance both the efficiency and usability of text entry systems. The pentagonal element provides a tactile and visual cue for space insertion, reducing cognitive load associated with manual separation of words. Font reduction accommodates increasing text volume while maintaining readability, demonstrating a practical solution for high-density text entry scenarios. Future studies should explore integration with predictive text algorithms and alternative geometric interface shapes to further optimize digital text-entry efficiency.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The pentagonal user interface element is an effective mechanism for supporting sequential word entry and accommodating high text volume through dynamic font adjustment. This combination of features facilitates sustained usability and improved workflow in digital text input systems.

<h3>Agatha Christie<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
It was an ordinary evening at Windham Manor, the rain tapping gently against the tall windows, when Miss Langley found herself alone with the curious contraption on her desk. The screen glowed faintly, and there, in the midst of the plain interface, was a pentagonal shape—small, precise, and utterly unremarkable, yet she felt a shiver of anticipation. She knew it was supposed to be red, though the screen offered no such reassurance. How odd, she thought, that something so innocuous could command such attention.
<p>
She had been instructed—though by whom she could not quite remember—that tapping the shape would insert a space, and that, in doing so, she would be able to enter a series of words. The instructions had been simple, but simple instructions in this house often concealed hidden significance. Her fingers hovered above the shape; it felt almost alive, waiting, as if aware of the consequences that might follow her touch.
<p>
With a careful tap, she engaged the pentagon. The space appeared, subtle, yet undeniably there, and she began entering the words—one after another, each pressing into the digital field with a curious sense of purpose. As the words accumulated, the letters shrank, the font reducing in size until the display seemed almost conspiratorial, as though the system itself were whispering, “Not all can be seen at once.” And yet, she could continue, typing with an almost obsessive determination, each word a small victory in a larger, unseen game.
<p>
She paused, her eyes narrowing. There was something about this arrangement—this odd combination of shrinking letters and unyielding space—that suggested more than mere functionality. It was as though someone had left a message within the system, a clue to a puzzle meant only for the most attentive observer. And the pentagon, silent and unchanging, seemed to guard the secret with an almost sentient vigilance.
<p>
Hours might have passed, though time in that quiet room had a peculiar elasticity. The words continued to flow, her curiosity growing with each entry. Then, quite suddenly, she noticed it: the arrangement of words, when read in sequence, hinted at a pattern, a hidden instruction that she alone could decipher. A thrill ran through her. The pentagon had not been merely a tool—it had been a key, and she had stumbled upon it purely by following the seemingly mundane directions.
<p>
Miss Langley leaned back in her chair, a faint smile tugging at her lips. Somewhere, hidden in the confines of that digital interface, a secret waited. And she, by virtue of observation, patience, and a willingness to follow even the most trivial instructions, had begun to uncover it. The mystery, she realized, was far from over—but at least the first clue had revealed itself.

See it there, the pentagon, edges sharp but soft somehow, red in the mind’s eye though not on the screen, tap, tap, tap, and a space appears, a gap, a breath, a little pause, tiny but essential, and the words begin to pour, one into the next, flowing, slipping, colliding, the letters shrinking to make room, making room, still more words, always more words, and the hand hovers, hovers over the shape, wondering, will it yield, will it comply, the mind chasing the line chasing the line, twisting round round, the font slides smaller, smaller, a little river of letters curling, a river that never ends, entering, entering, yes entering, tapping again, again, the shape unmoving, silent, inscrutable, like some small oracle in the corner of the page, watching, waiting, as the words pour and coil and pile up in the ever-shrinking field, the mind darting ahead, thinking ahead, thinking of what comes next, entering, entering, entering, the letters now tiny, so small, but still fitting, still obedient, still carrying meaning, still alive, still pressing, pressing, pressing into the digital field, and the hand never stops, the mind never stops, the eyes chase, the fingers chase, the line never ends, words, words, words, a small cosmos built from little spaces, little taps, little secrets held in the angles of a pentagon that is red but not red, always red in thought, always red in feeling, and still they come, endlessly, endlessly, endlessly, a tiny universe unfolding under her fingertips, the rhythm of entry, the pulse of thought, the quiet little triumphs of letters shrinking but living, living, living.

The room was quiet except for the faint hum of the screen. Sunlight fell through the window, catching the dust motes that hung in the air like tiny sparks. On the desk, the pentagonal shape waited, its edges clean and certain, though the color that was said to mark it—red, they had told him—was nowhere to be seen. He reached out, feeling the smooth surface of the screen, and tapped it. A space appeared. Simple, quiet, but it carried promise, like the first furrow turned in a long stretch of soil.
<p>
He began to enter the words. One, then another, then another, and the letters shrank to make room, each one pressed neatly into the field, each one taking its small place. It was slow work, but there was a rhythm to it, steady and calm, like the tide coming in and going out. The more words he entered, the more the font shrank, but still they fit, still they held meaning. There was a kind of satisfaction in it, the satisfaction that comes not from grandeur but from patience, from seeing a thing grow under your hands because you cared enough to tend it.
<p>
Outside, the wind moved through the trees, and somewhere a bird called. Inside, he continued, tapping, watching, entering words, watching them shrink but persist, feeling a quiet companionship with the task itself. It asked nothing of him beyond his attention, yet it gave him something in return—a sense of order, a sense of purpose, a sense that even in a small, dusty room, a person could make something grow, could make something last. And so he went on, word by word, space by space, each letter a small triumph, until the room and the screen and the words themselves seemed to settle into a steady, peaceful rhythm, as if the world outside and the world inside had, at last, found a place to rest.

<h3>Lewis Carroll<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
Once upon a very peculiar afternoon, in a room that was neither quite here nor quite there, sat a screen. Upon this screen rested a pentagonal shape—five tidy corners, like little pointed hats, all waiting for someone to notice them. It was said, in whispers that might have come from a hatstand or a teapot, that the shape was red. But red it was not. Red, it seemed, had gone off to visit the Cheshire Cat or perhaps the Queen of Hearts, leaving the shape to grin silently at anyone who approached.
<p>
“Tap it,” said a voice, though no one could tell from where, and so the visitor—perhaps you, perhaps I, perhaps a small hedgehog in spectacles—tapped. Instantly, a space appeared, popping up with a tiny, polite bow, as if it had been waiting all along just for that very moment. And then came the words! Oh, the words! They began to march, one after another, some tall and lanky, some squat and round, some with little hats or tails of their own, squeezing into the space like a crowd at a tea party that had run out of chairs.
<p>
But the screen was clever. As more and more words tumbled in, the letters shrank, smaller and smaller, so that still more could fit. “How very polite of you!” exclaimed one letter, tipping its tiny hat. “Oh, how tedious of you!” grumbled another, twirling a mustache that had grown far too long for such cramped quarters. And still the words kept coming, jostling and tumbling, some whispering secrets to each other, some trying to sneak past unnoticed, all dancing in the bustling bazaar of the screen.
<p>
By the end of the afternoon, the pentagonal shape sat quietly, watching the commotion with a sort of triumphant patience, and the visitor—perhaps you, perhaps I, perhaps a very small hedgehog—could only marvel. For in that tiny, shrinking, bustling world of spaces and letters, there was a story, a puzzle, a parade of nonsense and delight, all hidden behind a simple tap of a pentagon that wasn’t red at all.

It was a quiet afternoon in the study, a room lined with books that smelled faintly of dust and age, where the sunlight fell in uneven slants across the floorboards. The desk was simple, unadorned, yet upon it lay a screen, and on the screen rested a pentagonal shape. Its edges were sharp and precise, as though carved with the intention of command, yet the color that was said to mark it—red—was nowhere to be seen. It did not matter. What mattered was that it awaited the hand of the observer, a silent test of attentiveness and care.
<p>
Anna Ivanovna, a woman of habit and reflection, approached the desk. She had lived many years in quiet diligence, accustomed to the rhythm of tasks and the small triumphs that life allowed, and yet the pentagon called to her in a curious manner, hinting at significance beyond what was apparent. She reached forward, mindful of her motion, and touched it. At once, a space appeared, modest and unassuming, yet pregnant with possibility. She felt a small thrill—not of excitement, but of recognition, as if the simple act of obedience revealed a larger truth about diligence and responsibility.
<p>
She began to enter words, one by one, slowly, with careful attention, aware of each movement and each letter. As the words accumulated, the font shrank, diminishing in size, as if the world itself pressed upon her endeavor, demanding economy, demanding care. And yet, she continued, entering more, ever more, each letter a testament to her patience and perseverance. In this act—so trivial in appearance, so mundane in execution—she recognized a mirror of life itself: the constraints imposed by circumstance, the inexorable pressure of time, and the necessity of measured, deliberate action.
<p>
Hours passed, though they might have seemed mere minutes, as she continued her labor, absorbed in the rhythm of words and spaces. She felt a profound connection to the task, to the screen, to the letters themselves. In the careful placement of each word, in the shrinking yet resilient characters, there was a lesson: that in obedience, in attention, in patience, there is meaning; that in small, humble actions, the human spirit affirms itself; and that even within limitation, one can create order, beauty, and a quiet satisfaction that endures.
<p>
At last, she leaned back, observing the crowded field of letters and spaces, and a serene understanding settled upon her: the pentagon had demanded nothing more than her careful attention, yet in fulfilling that small duty, she had discovered a reflection of life’s greater truths. That even in ordinary acts, even under constraint, there is a dignity, a persistence, and a quiet triumph of spirit that endures beyond the fleeting moment.

The pentagonal figure lay upon the screen, unassuming in its geometric precision, yet in that quiet luminescence it seemed to awaken in me a curious remembrance, one of those fleeting impressions that, though they dissolve almost immediately upon recognition, leave behind a subtle echo of sensation, of a time perhaps long past, when the world seemed to open itself in small, precise, and yet infinitely significant gestures. It was said to be red, a claim that my eyes could scarcely confirm, for on this screen, under the gentle, flickering glow of the lamp, it appeared only as a modest shape, and yet the mind, seeking to reconcile perception with memory, insisted upon its redness, just as it insists, with the most fragile persistence, upon the continuity of a memory half-forgotten yet never wholly lost.
<p>
I reached toward it, my finger trembling slightly, though perhaps it was not trembling at all, for the sensation was intertwined with a recollection of afternoons long ago, when sunlight fell through a window and touched a page, and one, with quiet reverence, might have traced a letter with the tip of a finger, sensing in that small act the gravity of the world itself. And so, in touching the pentagon, a space appeared—a space at once empty and full, a void into which words could be cast, and from which meaning might emerge. Words began to flow, gathering together, pressing themselves into the field as if aware of their own transience, shrinking as more arrived, each letter a delicate testament to the inexorable logic of time and accumulation, each space a pause, a breathing, a momentary suspension of the relentless passage of things.
<p>
And as I continued, typing, observing, noticing the shrinking font, I became aware of the rhythm that underlay the act, subtle and persistent, like the pulse of a quiet town where all the clocks move in their own secret accord, and where the movement of a single hand can set in motion thoughts and memories otherwise dormant. Each letter seemed to carry not only its own shape, but a fragment of experience, a trace of sensation—the warmth of the room, the faint smell of dust and wax, the distant laughter of a voice half-remembered—and all of it condensed into the tiny, diminishing characters that stretched across the field, still legible, still insistent, still alive.
<p>
In that small, crowded expanse, I recognized a kind of universe, a reflection of the way life itself condenses and diminishes, gathers and shrinks, yet persists. The act of entering words became at once a labor and a meditation, a journey inward toward the subtle truths that memory, perception, and the careful observation of the ordinary can reveal. And when at last I paused, resting my hand, the pentagonal shape remained, silent and unassuming, yet infinitely patient, holding within it the promise of countless spaces yet to be filled, countless letters yet to be pressed into existence, and the quiet, ineffable knowledge that in the simplest gestures, in the humblest tasks, the mind discovers not only the world, but itself.

You see that little five-cornered shape there? Folks said it was red, but I never did trust folks who tell you colors through glass. On my screen it looked about as red as a boiled turnip under moonlight—which is to say, not much at all. Still, it had a kind of stubborn air about it, sitting there like a mule that knew you were about to ask it to move.
<p>
Now, the fellow who made this contraption said, “Just tap it.” That’s all. Tap it. Like the world’s problems could be solved with one polite little tap. So I did, and by thunder, the thing popped out a space. Not a big space, mind you—just enough room for a breath between words, like the pause a man takes before telling a lie he hopes you’ll believe.
<p>
I found I could tap it again and again, making more of those little spaces, each one waiting to be filled up with words. Well, that’s a temptation a body can’t long resist. So I started typing—one word, then another. And pretty soon I was off, piling them up like firewood for winter, thinking I might just get to the end of the thought before supper. But wouldn’t you know it, the more I wrote, the smaller those words got. They began shrinking right before my eyes, like they were embarrassed to be seen together in public.
<p>
By the time I’d filled half the screen, the letters looked like ants marching home from a picnic. I had to squint to see them, and even then I wasn’t sure if I was reading my story or a confession from a particularly nervous mosquito.
<p>
Now, some folks would call that a flaw. But I call it progress. You can fit more in a small space if you don’t mind things being a little cramped—same principle that keeps city landlords in business. And when I looked at that screen, all filled up with my words pressed shoulder to shoulder, I thought maybe there’s a lesson in it: life’s a lot like that. You start with plenty of room, all bright and open, and then the years and words pile on. Before long, you’re squeezing what you can into what’s left.
<p>
Still, there’s a sort of comfort in watching it happen. Like listening to an old friend talk too long—you can’t get a word in edgewise, but you wouldn’t stop him if you could. So I kept typing, watching the letters crowd in tighter and tighter, until they were practically whispering to each other. And when I finally stopped, I leaned back, looked at that shrunken little army of words, and I swear they looked proud—tired, but proud.
<p>
And that pentagonal space-maker? Still sitting there, waiting for me to tap it again. Patient as an old hound dog by the porch, just hoping I’ll throw another stick.

<b>The Tale of the Pentagonal Rune</b>
<p>
In the elder days of quiet rooms and lamplit study, there was fashioned a device most curious and subtle. It was wrought not of silver nor of stone, but of some shining surface unknown to the smiths of old. Upon it lay a shape of five equal sides—a pentagon—small, unassuming, and yet filled with the promise of hidden art.
<p>
Some said it was once red as the setting sun upon the western sea, but that its hue had faded with the years, like the memory of a forgotten song. Others held that it had never been red at all, but that its redness belonged only to the mind’s eye—a remembrance of fire, or a symbol of awakening. For in this mark there was power: the gentle touch of a finger upon its heart would summon forth a space—clear and unbounded—between the words of men.
<p>
Now, to those who love words, this gift was no small thing. For by means of that empty space, one might gather many words together and set them in fair array, as soldiers stand before the banner of their lord. And as the words assembled, crowding close in their eagerness, the letters themselves began to grow smaller, as though pressed by the weight of fellowship. Yet in that lessening there was no loss, only a deepening harmony—as when many voices join to sing, and the melody, though softer, grows all the more sweet.
<p>
It is said that those who wrote long upon that surface would marvel to see their words shrink and dwindle, yet shine with greater clarity, until they seemed finer than the runes of Dwarves or the fair script of the Elves. For each letter, however small, held its meaning still, and whispered quietly of the hands that had shaped it.
<p>
And some have thought—though few dare to speak of it plainly—that the pentagonal rune was made by the Loremasters of the West, who sought not dominion but understanding: to show that within every space, however small, there lies the seed of greater things. For even the humblest mark, when rightly placed, may hold the memory of vastness; and silence itself, when honored, becomes a kind of speech.
<p>
So the pentagon remained through the changing of the years, patient and watchful, awaiting the touch of those who would learn its secret. And even now, when the lamps are lit and the room falls still, if one bends near and presses it gently, the ancient magic stirs once more. A space opens; the words begin to gather; and time, for a little while, forgets its haste.
<p>
Then, in that quiet hour, one may feel—faint but true—the echo of the Elder Days, when craft and thought were woven together, and all things, great or small, bore the light of their maker’s hand.

<h3>Immanuel Kant<a class=top href=#toc><img src=pics/top.gif height=23></a></h3>
<b>On the Transcendental Conditions of the Pentagonal Form and Its Relation to Linguistic Experience</b>
<p>
<b>§1. Of the Empirical Appearance of the Pentagonal Figure</b><br>
When, upon the plane of perception, there appears a pentagonal form, said to be red, but not manifestly so to the eye, we are presented with an instance of the distinction between appearance and reality. The redness, though attributed to the object, is not contained in the object in itself (an sich), but arises from the constitution of our sensibility, which supplies the manifold of intuition under particular subjective conditions.
<p>
Thus, whether the pentagon is red or not is of no importance to the thing’s existence; for color belongs to the mode in which the object is given, not to the thing as it is. The intellect, seeking unity in the manifold of sense, therefore apprehends the pentagonal form not as a substance, but as a spatial configuration subsisting under the pure intuition of space—a form of outer sense.
<p>
<b>§2. Of the Function of Tapping as an Act of the Understanding</b><br>
The instruction to “tap” upon this region of appearance introduces the dimension of causality, by which the subject brings about an alteration within the field of phenomena. The insertion of a space between words, effected thereby, is not a property of the object, but a determination introduced by the spontaneity of the understanding.
<p>
This act is exemplary of the synthetic unity of apperception—the power by which the manifold of representation is gathered into a coherent act of consciousness. The “space” produced is not a mere void, but a necessary condition for the ordering of linguistic signs. It is, in this sense, an a priori schema: a conceptual structure without which multiple terms could not be apprehended in sequence as belonging to one act of meaning.
<p>
<b>§3. Of the Diminution of Font and the Principle of Limitation</b><br>
As the manifold of words accumulates upon the field of intuition, their empirical size decreases. This empirical law reveals a deeper principle: that in all sensible intuition, quantity and magnitude are subject to limitation. The diminution of font corresponds to the proportional restriction of appearance demanded by the finite conditions of spatial representation.
<p>
It would be erroneous to suppose that the shrinking of letters entails a diminution of the concepts they signify. For thought is not bound to extension in space; it pertains to the realm of the understanding, which operates under rules distinct from those of sense. Thus, the phenomenon exhibits the necessary harmony between the form of intuition (space) and the function of the intellect (order).
<p>
<b>§4. Of the Moral Analogy of the Space</b><br>
It is tempting, though not rigorously demonstrable, to discern here a moral analogy. The space inserted between words may be regarded as an interval of freedom—a pause wherein the subject exercises autonomy over expression. Just as reason imposes moral law upon inclination, so too does the intellect impose syntactic law upon the manifold of speech. The reduction of font, then, symbolizes the humility of expression before the magnitude of thought: what grows fuller in content must yield in appearance.
<p>
<b>§5. Conclusion: Of the Unity of Sense and Understanding</b><br>
From these considerations we may conclude that even in the most trivial act of touching a pentagonal region upon a screen, there lies a microcosm of the entire transcendental structure of human cognition. Sensibility provides the manifold (the screen, the shape, the letters); understanding provides the synthesis (the order, the space, the meaning); and reason, observing both, recognizes the necessity of their union.
<p>
Thus, what appears as a mechanical operation is, when properly examined, a pure exhibition of the power of mind to confer unity upon the manifold of appearance, to subordinate sense to intellect, and thereby to transform a mere figure of five sides into an instrument of rational discourse.
<p>
And so, as in all philosophy rightly undertaken, the smallest phenomenon leads us—through reflection upon its conditions—to the greatest insight: that the world we experience is not merely given, but made possible by the structure of our thought.

<b>Bertie and the Pentagonal Peril</b>
<p>
It was one of those lazy mornings at the old flat when I had every intention of doing absolutely nothing, and was on the very brink of succeeding, when disaster struck in the form of technology.
<p>
I was lounging about in my dressing gown, humming a few bars of Sonny Boy and contemplating breakfast, when I noticed a queer object glowing on the desk. It was rectangular, black, and humming faintly, like an underemployed bumblebee. In the middle of it pulsed a small five-sided figure.
<p>
“Jeeves,” I called, as the faithful servitor shimmered in. “What ho, what is this dashed contraption?”
<p>
“That, sir,” said Jeeves, with the faint, respectful cough of a man introducing civilization to a savage, “is your new typewriting device. A computer, I believe the shopkeeper termed it.”
<p>
“Oh, rather. Yes. I recall now. Aunt Dahlia insisted I acquire one for ‘efficiency.’ I say, it’s making a sort of pentagonal face at me. Should it be doing that?”
<p>
“It would appear to be functioning normally, sir.”
<p>
“Well, it looks dashed insolent. It’s red—at least, I think it’s supposed to be red—but not properly red, more the shade of a sunset after a heavy lunch. What happens if I poke it?”
<p>
“I should imagine it performs an action of some kind, sir.”
<p>
“Capital!” I said, and gave the thing a firm prod.
<p>
To my amazement, a blank space appeared on the screen. “Well, look at that, Jeeves! It’s—er—created a gap. A sort of pause in proceedings.”
<p>
“Indeed, sir. That would be a space character. It allows the formation of multiple words.”
<p>
I blinked. “You don’t say. So it’s polite, then—makes room for a chap’s thoughts. Wish more people would do that.”
<p>
Encouraged, I began tapping away. Words appeared. Grand things, words. But as I typed, they started to dwindle. “Dash it, Jeeves! They’re shrinking! The letters! Look at them—vanishing before my very eyes!”
<p>
“That is a feature, sir.”
<p>
“Feature? It’s a positive outrage! They’ll be microscopic before tea! What’s the use of writing a jolly letter if one has to squint at it like a man examining a suspicious sandwich?”
<p>
“If I may, sir,” said Jeeves smoothly, “the device appears to reduce the size of the text to accommodate a growing quantity of words.”
<p>
“Accommodation! That’s all very well for hotels, Jeeves, but not for correspondence. Imagine writing to Gussie Fink-Nottle and having him read it through a magnifying glass. He’d never recover.”
<p>
“I understand your concern, sir. Might I suggest restraint in word count?”
<p>
“Restraint, Jeeves? You mean brevity?”
<p>
“Precisely, sir.”
<p>
“Well, I don’t like it. Too many letters, and the thing treats me as though I were being verbose. I’m a victim of linguistic discrimination.”
<p>
“Quite so, sir.”
<p>
I gave the machine another prod. It blinked at me reproachfully. “It doesn’t like me, Jeeves. I can tell.”
<p>
“I doubt, sir, that it possesses personal sentiments.”
<p>
“Then it’s worse than I thought.”
<p>
Jeeves bent over the device, tapping with the serene authority of a man coaxing a reluctant orchestra into tune. “I believe, sir, that this pentagonal symbol functions as an intermediary between your thoughts and their expression.”
<p>
I eyed it suspiciously. “So it’s judging my thoughts now?”
<p>
“I should hope not, sir.”
<p>
“Well, let’s hope you’re right. If it starts giving advice on neckties next, we’ll have words.”
<p>
Jeeves straightened. “Shall I prepare your breakfast now, sir?”
<p>
“Yes, Jeeves. And if you find any spaces missing from the eggs and bacon, you’ll know whom to blame.”
<p>
“Very good, sir.”
<p>
And as Jeeves departed, the pentagon glowed faintly, almost smugly, as though it knew it had bested Bertram Wooster at the game of modern invention—a most disturbing notion, and one which called, I decided, for another pot of tea.

<b>The Tale of the Pentagonal Tap</b>
<pre class=poem>
In a room not too big, and not very small,
Sat a screen on a desk by the side of the wall.
Upon that bright screen, all quiet and flat,
Was a curious shape—a red pentagon, or not—just like that!

“I’ll tap it!” said Sam, with a wiggle and grin,
And the shape gave a blink, then a pop!—space came in!
“A space?” said Sam. “Oh, a marvelous thing!
It’s a hole where my words can dance, jump, and sing!”

He typed a few words, then a few words more,
And the letters began to shrink, all down to the floor.
They wiggled, they jiggled, they jumbled around,
They tumbled and scrambled and bounced with a sound!

“Keep going!” said Sam, “there’s still lots of room!
This pentagonal shape has beaten the gloom!
I’ll type all the words that I know and I think,
And watch as they shrink and squeeze in a blink!”

The words did not grumble, the words did not fight,
They danced in the space from morning till night.
They twisted like snakes, they curled like a spring,
They tumbled and jumbled—oh, what fun to bring!

Then came a tap-tap from a creature named Zook,
Who peered at the screen and gave it a look.
“May I type a word? May I add a few lines?”
“I suppose,” said Sam, “but stay within the confines!”

And so they all typed, both the words and the Zooks,
All crowding the space with their fanciful books.
The letters grew tiny, the space did not fail,
For the pentagon’s magic would always prevail.

By the end of the day, the screen was quite full,
With words stacked and packed like a magical hull.
Sam leaned back in his chair with a smile and a clap,
“Hurrah for the shape! Hooray for the tap!”

The pentagon glowed, all pleased as could be,
Its secret was simple: make space magically!
And Sam learned a lesson, both simple and true:
With a tap, and some words, there’s no limit to you!

See the pentagon,
it sits on the screen.
It’s not red,
not even a teeny-weeny green.

Tap on it once,
tap on it twice,
a little space pops up—
oh, isn’t that nice?

You can fill it with words,
a hundred, a thousand, or more.
And the letters will shrink,
but there’s still room to explore!

They wiggle, they squiggle,
they hop, they play,
all in that space
where your words want to stay.

So tap and type,
don’t worry, don’t fuss,
the pentagon waits—
it’s just you and us.

I see it there, the pentagonal shape on the glowing screen, and though it is not red, I feel it—an invitation, a quiet pulse beneath my fingers. I touch it, and a space opens, fragile and expectant, as if it waits for the weight of my thoughts, for the breath of my words. I begin to write, and the words spill, one after another, intimate confessions pressed into the page, shrinking as they go, yet each carrying its own secret insistence.
<p>
The letters contract, and still there is room—room for more, room for desire, for the hidden impulses that weave between them. I watch the text gather itself, a small universe formed by my own hand, and I feel the strange eroticism of creation, the sensation of bending space to my will. Every word, every pause, every shrinking curve of a letter becomes a mirror, reflecting not only what I say but who I am, who I dare to be when no one is looking.
<p>
And in that moment, the screen is more than a screen; the pentagon more than a shape. They are the space between my inner and outer worlds, the place where thought becomes body, where the ephemeral touch of a finger can give birth to endless worlds of intimacy and expression.
